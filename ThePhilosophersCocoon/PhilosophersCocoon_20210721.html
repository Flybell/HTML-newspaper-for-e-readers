Specifically:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">how do I finish them?</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">does everyone else find them as difficult to finish as I do?</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">It has been five years since my Phd and have managed to publish some stuff that I am happy with. I have never found starting writing particularly onerous, and generally enjoying getting the first 80% down. But, I always find the last 20% –actually getting the thing into a submittable state takes me an enormous amount of time.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Right now, I have a more than 80% of a paper finished –but it has been at this stage for the last month despite me working on it pretty much every day.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">I find that a paragraph that I need to fix/alter slightly/rewrite will lead to me needing to fix/alter/slightly/rewrite another part of the paper. And so on...</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">So, I guess a couple of things could be happening:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">1. Many people go through something like this and it is just a normal part of finishing papers.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">2. I am doing something wrong. perhaps I need to get ideas more clear in my head before I start writing?</p><p>Yeah, I think this is totally normal--or, at least, it's something that I struggle with too. I love drafting new papers. <em>Finishing</em> them, on the other hand, is the tricky part. It takes a ton of polishing, and this in my experience is the least fun and most difficult part to do. You constantly fiddle with things, insert and remove things, second-guess yourself, and so on. I currently have maybe ten papers like this that are 80-90% done, but which I'm finding it difficult to polish into the kind of shape that I'm happy enough with to submit. And what often happens is that I have an idea for a new paper, so I'll begin drafting that up because I find that more enjoyable (this is in part the reason why I have so many papers in the 'polish' stage). </p><p>Maybe the OP and I are outliers in this regard, I don't know--but I suspect not. <strong>Any readers care to weigh in? </strong>And any tips for the OP to help them get to the finish line more quickly?</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/starting-v-finishing-papers/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/starting-v-finishing-papers/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>It's the same here.

	</p><p>I think this is a *really* common struggle in our field (though not necessarily specific to our field) but it a real problem for meeting professional expectations. Grad school imposes a lot of deadlines - so that can remove part of the problem (the paper is 100% done when it is due, not when you feel it is perfect) but even that can be a problem for students who perpetually take incompletes instead of turning in papers, or can't finish a dissertation. </p><p>In the post-PhD world my strategy is to create deadlines for myself. Sometimes I make them up, sometimes I set my sights on a special issue submission with a fixed deadline. This helps. It might mean I send out work that is good but not the greatest it ever could be (but what does that mean anyway for it to be the greatest it could be? and according to whom? even if I think it is perfect Reviewer 2 will likely disagree). Now I find the papers that languish in the 80% done phase are the ones I feel most invested in, oddly enough, because those are the ones I most want to get *right* and most want to see in an especially *good* journal and they are therefore the hardest to polish up and finalize to my imagined standard for them. I look forward to other comments and suggestion on this topic. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I don't think you're doing anything wrong, this part of writing certainly can take a lot of time. </p><p>That said, it is the part of writing I actually like the most, because I find it easier to feel motivated to work on a paper in know is almost there than one I'm not sure will ever get there. </p><p>Different problems for different people I guess. I find the middle part of writing the hardest: filling in the details after I have drafted out the main parts of the paper but before I am just polishing and working on the expression of the paper. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Totally normal. I struggle with this as well. A professor once told me, 'you never finish a paper; you merely stop working on it.' I think that's fundamentally right.</p><p>A piece of advice I've been given and like: just ignore the paper for some time (2-4 weeks). Then re-read it. If you are pleasantly surprised with it, maybe its time to stop tinkering. If you would be embarrassed for it to be published as it (because of that page, or these paragraphs), keep tinkering. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='e'>Which Objections Should You Include in a Paper?</h3><p>This is a guest post by <a href="https://andrewymoon.wordpress.com/">Andrew Moon</a>, Assistant Professor at Virginia Commonwealth University.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">When philosophers write papers, they also discuss objections to their own arguments. But how much should they do this? A paper could go on forever with discussions of more and more objections, making the paper unhelpfully long.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">ONE way to know which objections to include is to present your paper at a few conferences and run your main argument by a few people in the relevant area of expertise. If an objection commonly comes up (e.g., it's the first thing that comes to mind when you mention your argument to someone), then that's evidence that it should be dealt with in the paper. Idiosyncratic objections (which might still be good objections!) probably needn't be dealt with.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">These factors matter because they make the paper better and more enjoyable to read. More people will enjoy reading a paper if the objection mentioned is the one they have, not an idiosyncratic one that they don't find plausible. Following this advice will also increase the probability that you will deal with the objections a referee is likely to have.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">This has implications for when YOU are the referee. The fact that you have a good objection to the argument in a paper you are refereeing isn't sufficient reason to not accept. It takes some knowledge of how people in the philosophical community would likely respond to the argument. It also requires some self-awareness of how idiosyncratic of a philosopher you are. These factors will help you know whether the objection you are thinking of is sufficient reason to not accept the paper.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/which-objections-should-you-include-in-a-paper/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/which-objections-should-you-include-in-a-paper/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='a'>How many (outside) letters are optimal?</h3><p>A reader writes in:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">I have a couple of questions about getting job letters from people outside of your graduate program. </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">First, when is it a good time to ask someone for a job letter? How well does a potential letter writer need to know you to write a sufficient letter? </p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">Second, I will likely have at least two external job letters when I go on the market. Is this enough or would more be better? How many letters does one need on the market?</p><p>Excellent questions. Here is how I replied:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">I don’t think there’s a simple answer to the first question, as in my experience different people can have different standards for how well they think they should know you in order to write a good letter. So, here’s my suggestion: if you have some working relationship with the person and <em>any</em> reason to think the person knows your work and may think well of you as a philosopher, it doesn’t hurt to ask. The worst that can happen is that they say ‘no’—but the best that can happen is that they say ‘yes’ and write a good letter. I’ve had both happen to me, and while it’s disappointing when someone says ‘no’, the only way to get some ‘yes’ answers is to ask.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">On the second question, I think two outside letters is more than enough, particularly for someone just coming out of graduate school. Indeed, given that many job application portals limit the number of letters that you can submit, there is such a thing as having ‘too many letters.’ I think four or five letters total (2 or 3 from your grad program, and likewise from outside) is probably optimal.</p><p>But these are just my thoughts. <strong>What do you all think?</strong></p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/how-many-outside-letters-are-optimal/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/how-many-outside-letters-are-optimal/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>A side issue: resist the temptation to get many letters.  Some people seem to think the more the merrier.  But in fact, I think - due to a salience bias - people reading a file often remember a weaker letter.  So if you have three good strong letters, and one okay letter, a committee member may focus on that one.  They may even see it as "more honest".  So do not be tempted into an arms race with numbers of letters.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>A slightly different side issue: I think it’s wise to ask every single person who you think *can* write you a strong letter to do so. Not because you’ll use them all (Marcus and the previous commenter are right about this) but because it’s good to have good people think good thoughts about you and then write them down. Later when some such person is e.g. thinking about who to invite on their next edited volume, they’re more likely to think of you. There’s something at least very like the Franklin effect to think about here. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Letters are not that useful to most committees, I think, so don't go overboard. Three is perfect; five is overboard. Have one that speaks to your research, another to your teaching, a third that's more general, and you've got it covered. Committees know that letter writers tend to oversell things, so they discount the praise somewhat and substitute their own judgement on your writing sample, teaching materials, and other evidence in the file--focus on making those things excellent. Having a letter from a well-known person who honestly says "best student I've had in a decade" certainly won't hurt, but even that isn't likely to be definitive in any given search.</p><p>If you use a credential service and have a (reliable, experienced) placement officer, try requesting five letters and then having your placement officer recommend which three to send (and to tell you if any of them should not be used).</p><p>If you have been out of grad school for a year or more, be sure to have the chair of the department where you have been teaching write you a letter (that's a sensible fourth letter). If they can't/won't, that probably tells you something important.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I think it depends what your AOSes are when you go on the market. For example, if you list ethics and political philosophy as AOSes but don't have a single political philosopher vouching for you then I think it's worthwhile to try to connect with a political philosopher who can do so. Likewise for other common AOS pairings like metaphysics and phil science or metaphysics and epistemology.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>This is quite common (or not rare).  Some people I know have had stellar careers, which benefited from such visits.  It is more common among the elite schools.  In Canada, PhDs are often encouraged to do it.  It is intended to "internationalize" you, make you less provincial.<br/>
I would not expect to be welcomed at a very selective school as a visitor, if you are from a rather lack-lustre place.  And it is bets that you have a rationale for going ... you are working on so-and-sos stuff and the chance to talk with her and attend her seminar would be great, etc.<br/>
If you are an international student in the USA, be sure to check that it does not compromise your visa conditions.  You do not want to be deported. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>When I needed to do this about 10 years ago when my now-spouse took a job in another city, my dissertation advisor reached out to a colleague at another institution and started the process. (So maybe the OP should discuss this with their advisor.) The institution I visited at for a year generously provided an office and library access, allowed me to sit-in on seminars, and invited me to colloquia and after-talk dinners with guest speakers. It was a fantastic experience.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I did this twice and had a great experience. It was very easy for me to set up the visit itself: I just asked my advisor to reach out to the relevant people, and they responded positively. </p><p>More challenging was securing funding. I got a scholarship to pay for a year of travel, but someone else from my program lost out on the scholarship and therefore wasn't able to travel.</p><p>Visas can be easy or challenging depending on the country. Some countries don't want to give visiting PhD students anything except a student visa, which is problematic because that costs a lot of money and often requires you to be paying tuition. Others (Australia) are really great, but only if you want to stay a short-ish time (I think it's 3 months?).</p><p>This experience might be atypical, since I was coming from a highly-ranked department, but I suspect that many universities are happy to have you if you can pay your own way.</p><p>One way that some people I know have funded a visit is to double-up on teaching in one semester, then use the money they've saved up to spend the next semester visiting another department. This can have negative or positive tax implications, depending on how you do it. </p><p>In my experience, most people really like having visitors around as long as you're sociable and have interesting things to say. It's nice to see new faces!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>From my understanding, the process can be quite different at different schools. But the first step is to email a potential sponsor and inquire about visiting. It’s safest to do this 9-months to a year before you want to visit, but you can also do so in the previous semester. </p><p>The sponsor will tell you the process, which can be more or less informal depending on the school. For example, some schools require that you go through an application process, hence partly why it’s important to inquire early. Other schools are less formal, and you just need the sponsor’s approval (and for them to not be on leave). You may end up as an official visitor (which often requires paying some fees but allows you to have a student ID card) or an unofficial one (no fees but may be harder to get a student ID). Being an official visitor matters more at some schools than others, and typically the process of becoming a visiting student will be sensitive to that. (Note: if you do have to pay fees, you can try to ask your dept to cover them.) </p><p>In short, the process is not very difficult. The main step is identifying and reaching out to a potential sponsor, and then applying if needed. </p><p>Of course, you also need to figure out how to identify potential sponsors/school. I would ask your advisor and other potential mentors for advice. It can also be nice to be in an area with at least a few schools around that have people you’d like to talk to/events you’d like to go to, so that you can really maximize. </p><p>As far as thinking ahead about potential sponsors, if you organize any talk series or reading groups, you might consider inviting people who you might want as sponsors down the line. (It’s particularly easy to invite people to things while things are still at least partly on Zoom, which may be true for the Fall.) But this advice may be more useful for people in earlier years.</p><p>Last thing: you *can* visit 2 schools in one semester and break it up into ~half semester each. This has pros and cons, but I know several people who did this and it worked out well for them. It really depends on your goals, the people you want to talk to, how many semesters you have that you can spend on visiting, and financial constraints/cost of living in new area vs. home area. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Just wanted to emphasize something mentioned in passing above: At most institutions, it is *much* easier to visit (as a student or faculty member!) if you have secured your own funding and will not be asking anything financial from them.  So you should be thinking about your funding source (for travel, housing, other costs of living) alongside thinking about where you'd like to visit.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I did this, and it was definitely beneficial to my career. I was invited as a visiting scholar by a senior faculty member in the department. They provided an office and held regular meetings with me. I had the privileges of a grad student. This was all possible because I had funding from my home department (it being my fourth year in the PhD program and first year ABD).</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

I'm four years out of my PhD from a top program, currently in a non-TT job, and have a book under contract with a top 5 press (according to a list published on that grumpy guy's blog). This book is - or rather will be - a significantly revised and expanded version of my dissertation. Here's what I did to get the contract:</p><p>First, I did NOT send my entire dissertation to a publisher, for two reasons. The first reason is that I hate my dissertation, as I had to rush to complete a 'good enough' version of it in order to graduate on time. I actually see my book as a way to fix all of my mistakes and turn the dissertation into what I initially thought it could be. The second reason is because I attended a publishing workshop as a PhD student, and a philosophy editor from a major press told me that he hates receiving full dissertations. They do not have the same purpose as a book, and as such (with a maybe a few exceptions), make very lousy and unmarketable books. </p><p>What I did instead was begin to establish a publishing record in the area of my book. I published a bunch of dissertation chapters as stand-alone articles in decent journals and developed a reputation as someone who works in the field. This way, when it came time to prepare my proposal, I could say that I had published a number of articles that I am now developing into a monograph, and the acquisitions editor could get a sense of the quality of my work and how it has been perceived by my peers. </p><p>In terms of preparing the proposal: I first contacted a few acquisitions editors at the presses that I most wanted to publish with and asked them if they were even interested in receiving a proposal. One said no on the grounds that they don't publish books based on dissertations (which is actually not true, but that's beside the point), while two said yes. Of those two, I selected the more prestigious one and prepared a proposal in accordance with the instructions their acquisitions editor sent to me. They reviewed the proposal, said it didn't fit with their current priorities, but told me it was a promising project and would probably be a good fit with some other publishers, one of which was the next on my list. </p><p>So I revised the proposal in accordance with the second publisher's format and sent it to their acquisitions editor. The editor ended up being really excited about the project and asked to see some material. So I sent three sample chapters that included previously published material. These chapters, along with the proposal, were sent out to two anonymous reviewers. A few months later, I received two positive and very helpful reports from the reviewers, and an offer for a book contract. As Marcus notes, the contract does stipulate that a certain percentage of the book must be previously unpublished material. In my case, this is going to be fine, but it won't be in all cases. </p><p>Hope this helps :)  </p><p></p><p> </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I think Mysterious book publisher gives great advice, and their story is a typical one.  I am a more senior person with my third book coming out with one of the two big publishers.<br/>
Publishers hate dissertations.  Oddly, some people asked me - at the time of my finishing - if I was going to try to publish my dissertation.  I did not, and I am glad for it.  It is a fine piece is work, but it lacks the coherence of a book, and given I was virtually unknown then, it would not have sold.<br/>
I think publishers are more lenient on how much previously published stuff is included in the dissertation than Marcus and Mysterious imply.  I think about 40% of my first book was previously published, but it was significantly reworked for the book.  I knew more,  and I wanted to connect that material to the new material in the book.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I echo the advice everybody gives above, that you should probably hold off on trying to publish a book based on your dissertation for a little bit, and that this book is going to need to be significantly different from your dissertation.</p><p>In my own case, I had published 3 papers based on my dissertation, but several other papers in my field but on different topics. I was contacted by the acquisitions editor of a press about five years after I had defended by dissertation, asking if I had a proposal to run by him. When I submitted the proposal, they wanted to confirm that there would be enough new material to warrant publication.</p><p>Most of the main claims and arguments in the book were drawn from the dissertation, but I totally redid the organization, jettisoned a lot of the lit review, and rewrote the thing. </p><p>I think it was useful to be able to return to this material after having moved on to other topics, and after having experience writing journal articles on other topics. Looking at my dissertation with fresh eyes, I cringed pretty often, although sometimes I said to myself, "Hey--that was pretty good!" I don't think I would have been able to write the book I did if I had started revamping the dissertation shortly after defending it.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I am in a similar position as Mysterious book publisher -- a non-TT faculty member with a forthcoming book based on my dissertation at a top press -- and I would second everything they said. </p><p>When thinking about the best strategy for approaching book editors, it can be helpful to think of the process from their perspective. They are flooded with pitches, especially from recent PhD graduates who want to publish their dissertations. Just sending a book manuscript out for review signals a significant investment in the project -- much more so than a journal editor's decision to send a paper out for review -- since presses pay their reviewers.</p><p>So before taking that step, university press editors are looking for evidence that the project will be of interest to scholars in the field and that the prospective author will actually deliver in finishing the book. There are various ways to demonstrate that evidence to an editor.</p><p>If you have an advisor or other distinguished faculty member who is a champion of your project and knows editors at top presses, their contacting an editor about your book project can be very helpful in getting the editor to seriously consider it. </p><p>If no fancy pants professor opens such doors for you, there are still ways to get a book contract. Publishing one or two articles from your dissertation shows that others in your field are interested in the project and that you can survive the peer review process. That makes your pitch to a book editor more compelling, especially if you are a recent PhD graduate who is reaching out cold to book editors, which was the case for me.</p><p>When you have a book proposal, some sample chapters, and ideally a journal article related to the project, that's a good time to reach out to book editors about it. You can email them your book proposal and CV a couple months before a conference to see if they would meet with you there to discuss the project. You'll get a sense of those who are interested and those who aren't.</p><p>Lots of editors told me they weren't interested in the project, but two expressed interest -- one at a top press and another at a decent but less highly ranked press. When I completed the book manuscript, I sent it to the former editor and offered him an exclusive right to review it, so that he knew he wouldn't be competing with other presses. That can help you, especially if you're a junior scholar whose early stage research program isn't likely to precipitate a bidding war between different presses. I also let the other editor know that the manuscript was under review at a different press as a courtesy. There's no reason to burn bridges unnecessarily. </p><p>Best of luck! Writing a book is a lot of work and a multi-year process, but it can help distinguish you in an increasingly competitive and absurd job market.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Really great advice above, all of which I agree with.  One further thing to add: A lot depends on what kind of dissertation you're writing.  It's become more popular these days to write a dissertation that's really just a set of interconnected articles preceded by an introductory survey chapter.  That sort of dissertation makes for a terrible book!  But even a more unified dissertation may need additional/different material to become a plausible book.  Personally, my dissertation was very unified and interconnected—it tried to build a new formal framework that solved a number of interconnected problems.  But before submitting it as a book manuscript, I had to add a lot of material, much of it designed to demonstrate to the reader that my framework had significant applications.  What you're trying to accomplish in a book is often very different from what one tries to accomplish in a dissertation.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='l'>How to juggle projects effectively?</h3><p>A reader writes in:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;">I'm looking for some advice about how to juggle different projects.  I put together a draft, sent it to a few folks for comment, and I received back one set of thorough comments already.  I'm wondering: Is it better to stick with one paper all the way through til it's ready to be submitted somewhere? --the idea being I have the material in my head so it's good to work on it while I have it all well-rehearsed.  Or is it better to sit on some of those comments and work up a different paper draft altogether so that when I do come back to the first project, I'll be looking at the comments and my own work with fresher eyes?  Bear in mind, (1) I have zero pubs and (2) I'm not talking about drafts that are submission ready nor am I talking about drafts that have been commented on by journal reviewers.  Maybe I'm asking a broader question related to a fruitful publishing program: is it better to complete one thing at a time start to finish or to have several papers going at any given time?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">These are really great questions. Although everyone works differently, my sense is that it may be a mistake to focus on just one project at a time. For better or worse, academia has become progressively more competitive. Job-candidates seem to have more publications than ever before, and so to be competitive on the market (and then, for tenure) one must publish quite a bit. And unfortunately, focusing on just one project at a time doesn't seem to me to be all that conducive to this--as to publish a lot, one has to get a lot out for review, and to get a lot out for review, one has to (I think) be drafting <em>and</em> revising multiple projects at any given time. Maybe this is wrong, and if so, I'd be curious to hear from readers who work on just one project at a time and are successful that way. In any case, I don't work that way. Allow me to briefly explain how I work (and why), and then open things up for comments.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/how-to-juggle-projects-effectively/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/how-to-juggle-projects-effectively/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>Generally speaking, I'm with Marcus: work on stuff simultaneously. I do a little bit every day (just an hour or two), and what I work on depends on what else is in the queue and what the deadlines are. Anything with an imminent deadline (i.e. 1-2 months from now) gets priority. </p><p>If I have a long working day, I will start with the imminent stuff then move on to less urgent stuff when my energy or interest starts to flag. Because my time is constrained these days--and because I don't like to write more than a couple hours a day anyway--I usually end up working on just one project a day. But I will alternate throughout the week as time and energy allow. If I'm making a big push on something then I will do all my writing on that one project for a while, but gear down later in the day with reading for other projects.</p><p>Usually, this means that revisions (i.e. R&amp;Rs) get priority, and new work takes a backseat until I've cleared my plate. Currently, it means I work on my book a few days a week, and alternate between an R&amp;R and a chapter with the same deadline on the others.</p><p>If you feel stuck or bored with one project, work on another for a little while instead. Putting all your energy into one thing that's not feeling very rewarding at present is a recipe for unhappiness.</p><p>For someone still trying to get their first pub under their belt, however, I'd recommend focusing their energy on revising that first paper. It's hard to get the swing of things early on, and I think you're liable to dilute your attention a little too much. If you're revising, you're close to submitting it, and you'll have months to work on other stuff while you wait for a verdict. </p><p>But do keep a running list of paper ideas, and don't hesitate to write a little if you have a thought about one of them.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I agree with the general point that to be publish effectively (one paper a year or more), you should be working on multiple papers at the same time. </p><p>I have never had any difficulty working on multiple projects, so it is hard to give advice. But I'd recommend two things to someone, like perhaps OP, who is starting out. First, have different projects at different stages. For instance, one paper at the 'getting feedback' stage; one paper at the drafting stage; one paper at the reading stage. That way, the work for each project feels different. </p><p>Second, experiment with forced time windows. For instance, work on one project Monday/Weds/Friday and the other on Tuesday/Thurs. Or one only in the morning, the other only at night. Sometimes people have a hard time switching between projects because they have a hard time 'getting into the mind set' of a project. By experimenting with forced time windows you can determine how long you need to get back into a project to effectively work. (Is it an hour? A day? A week? etc.)  </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Another plug for at least having a secondary project at all times: sometimes you will get stuck on your main project (for many reasons: genuine philosophical difficulty, lack of motivation, can't find those notes you wrote a week ago), and it is useful to have something else that is relatively easy to work on as a kind of fall back. That way you can always make some progress every day you work, which I find incredibly important to keeping up general motivation to work. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>One important point: given that you already have comments from one person, you really should revise that paper.  I think it would be quite inappropriate for you to ask that person for comments on another paper until you have placed this one, or at least sent it out to a journal (unless they have some special obligation to read your work, for example, they are on your committee).</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I used to think that alternating projects frequently was the best way for me to stay interested/motivated. Following some advice, I've recently been trying to focus for at least 3 weeks in a row on a single writing project (taking a small break between projects). I've been able to make more progress this way and I've also felt less overwhelmed. Also, when one of my papers seems more promising than the others (and/or is closer to being ready for submission), I try to prioritize it––only shifting to other projects occasionally when I need a break or when I'm waiting for feedback.</p><p>I personally don't often have enough energy to revise/edit a paper in the afternoon after having spent several hours in the morning on another paper, but everyone is different.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

This would be a series on people who have started doing philosophy later than their peers, maybe only going to graduate school in their forties, with the idea of showing people alternative career paths and encouraging people who feel out of place because they are older than the average graduate student. I also know someone who has done an MA in philosophy and has started on philosophical work (not yet published) in his 60s after retiring from a permanent position in a psychology department. The literary magazine The Millions started a series like this about ten years ago about authors who published their first book in their 40s or later. This includes many of my favourite authors, eg Barbara Pym. This has now grown into a separate website called Bloom <a href="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__bloomsite.wordpress.com_&amp;d=DwMFaQ&amp;c=XGugQOAYZ1dlZ6_YqmoVS7m-wN0lOUpZuda4oPsMe_0&amp;r=tJLbH_imdtpFA2xSRJSYNA&amp;m=3eDC629X3uzXjC09NqunwjjMtRc-Feu0DS3AsBk8iyQ&amp;s=xE89bCZ-V3E_BdrSmMdNODbkCQ7XZ99doFdTejgqYc0&amp;e=">https://bloomsite.wordpress.com/</a></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">I think this would be a great feature to have, showing that being an early career academic does not necessarily mean being young by age and you don’t have to be some kind of wunderkind to succeed. This could also showcase alternative career paths, like starting to publish philosophy after retirement or writing philosophy alongside an alt-ac job. I think there is a good chance that if I cannot get an academic job, I would try and continue research and writing alongside another (paying) career, so it would be nice to see other people doing this.</p><p>I think this is a great idea! <strong>If you took a non-traditional path into philosophy</strong> and are interested in contributing a guest-post on your experience and path in the profession, please just email me at <a href="mailto:marvan@ut.edu"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">marvan@ut.edu</span></a>.

In reality, however, the first thought should be amazing job opportunities. Kazakhstan is a developing country but it is developing fast. The capital, formerly known as Astana but now Nur-Sultan, is growing faster than one can keep track of. This is a perfectly normal course of events. Kazakhstan is a young but vast country, the 9<sup>th</sup> largest in the world in terms of physical size, with 18.5 million inhabitants. After a long period of being under the strong influence of Russia and the Soviet Union, Kazakhs are now re-discovering their language and national identity, and they are building their country according to their own preferences. The country is secular, multi-ethnic, and all religions are highly respected: Eastern Orthodox Christmas (7<sup>th</sup> of January), for example, is a national holiday, even though the country is predominantly Muslim. Kazakhstan is rich in oil and gas and thus it can afford to attract a skilled labour force and provide them with exceptional work conditions. For these reasons, this country offers many possibilities for excellent employment, philosophers included. Most foreigners work in the oil and gas industry in the south of the country but a very nice job can be found in cities like Nur-Sultan and Almaty.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/philosophy-in-kazakhstan/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/philosophy-in-kazakhstan/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>UW-Madison is very proud of its partnership with NU.

	</p><p>I, for one, am happy to be spared of unsolicited political commentary on this blog. I thought the entry was informative, and expat academics rarely have any insight on the politics of the country where they live that one can’t learn from a Wikipedia entry. Anyone who considers moving to a foreign country will likely brush up on the place and can decide for themselves whether the country’s political system is something they can make peace with. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I apologize for not discussing the political situation in Kazakhstan but (1) I thought that this was not relevant since it does not affect expats and this blog is principally designed for people looking for jobs in KZ and (2) I actually cannot tell you much more than what you can find out yourself. This is indeed a hybrid regime (an authoritarian system that ‘looks like’ democracy) but I am not sure that there is a significant lack of freedoms here. In fact, this seems like a well-functioning society; speaking from a position of a person who speaks Russian and has close connections with many ‘locals.’ I, for example, feel as safe as here I felt in New Zealand, much safer than how I felt in the USA – and I am not trying to be mean; I am just being honest. I regularly leave my stuff when I am in a coffee shop to go to use the restroom, and other people do this as well. And, to my knowledge, we haven’t had any real violence in the streets or a serious case of police brutality ever since I came here two years ago (I don’t follow government-owned media but independent sources). There are protests and demonstrations here and there but not violent. And the country is dealing with the Covid pandemic brilliantly.  </p><p>Corruption in Kazakh society is, more or less, a normal thing but none of this applies to our university (in fact, this is why Ethics is a mandatory course for all of our students!). I have clearly said in the text that acceptance is merit-based. Let me stress that here: acceptance at NU is strictly merit-based, period!! We will accept any gifted student, regardless of their religion, skin colour, hairstyle, sexual orientation (people don’t look favourably here on this but I am unaware of any incidents, and I read local newspapers regularly), political views (many of the students are critical of the government), social or financial status (we have a very high number of intellectually gifted children from extremely poor families), or any other characteristic. As a member of this and last year’s admission committees, I can personally guarantee that this is true. Children of wealthy or influential people can enrol but, if they are not good enough, they will pay for their education. And if they do not study, they will fail. At NU, we are principally interested in knowledge transfer. We are here to teach. And this is the main reason I accepted my position at this university (thank you God for this decision).</p><p>This is not Trump University in Donald City. This analogy is mean and misleading. This is Washington University in Washington (state) or Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Carnegie Mellon University, Lincoln University, to name a few. Nur-Sultan Nazarbayev, notwithstanding his flaws, has managed to secure independence and relative prosperity for Kazakhstan while not shedding an ounce of blood and while keeping great relationships with all neighbouring countries. As a person coming from Former Yugoslavia, I assure you that this is an amazing achievement. Nazarbayev is, in a sense, a father of this nation (perhaps, they could have had a better one but this is beside the point here) and its first president. If Washington or Lincoln can have universities named after them, perhaps Nazarbayev can have one as well. Nazarbayev is also the founder and a patron of this university and so it carries his name. There is nothing strange or ‘Donaldish’ about it (though I did subtly hint in the text that they could have gone for a better name, for practical reasons mainly). <br/>
I hope that this resolves all concerns that may arise. I am happy to reply to any other questions. Just flick me an email.  </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Please note that Washington University is in Missouri, not Washington state as you suggest, Vladimir. Only the University of Washington and Washington State University are in Washington state. There's also Washington &amp; Lee University, which is in neither Washington state nor Missouri, and George Washington University, which happens to be in Washington, D.C. So, Americans at least are perhaps not in a position to complain about this sort of naming scheme.</p><p>While we're at it, I'm writing this from the Rajiv Gandhi Education City in India, which I arrived at having flown into the country a few years ago via the Indira Gandhi International Airport and then having driven north past the Rajiv Gandhi Sports Complex and the Indira Gandhi Delhi Technical University for Women.

	</p><p>I also want to gently remind commenters (many of whom reside in countries that have great freedom of speech) that we have to be delicate and careful with political commentary, specifically on some countries/places. I've had difficulties soliciting posts for some countries because even a carefully worded post could have unforeseen consequences. We want to put the safety and wellbeing of our authors first! They offer us a valuable sense of what it's like to live and work as a philosopher in a given country, we don't intend to give an evenhanded report on the local political complexities. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

I would love to hear if others have found effective ways to manage and streamline this part of the late-early-career writing process.

Is their thought that everything they say across different papers must be entirely consistent? If so, I'm not sure that I think one needs to do that! Why not follow the arguments where they lead, publish things that <em>are</em> in tension with each other if that's where the arguments lead, and then perhaps explore and try to resolve those tensions in future work?</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/maintaining-a-coherent-research-program/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/maintaining-a-coherent-research-program/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>The felt requirement to make one's work consistent across years is based on the false assumption that anyone is reading all of one's work.

	</p><p>I generally agree with Marcus's responses. Context - I'm tenured at a regional university where I don't need a robust research program. I average about an article every 1-2 years. I'm working on a co-authored piece right now that is in some tension with one of my more-cited previous articles (previously I argued that X was a confused approach and we should prefer answer Y, in the new paper arguing that if/when we accept X there are certain parameters that should be included. I still prefer Y, but it's a controversial view). In this case, my attitude was that even if someone didn't wholly buy my previous argument, I still have additional ideas that I want to contribute to the scholarly conversation. I don't believe doing so will undermine the argument of either paper. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I admittedly don't fully understand the query because I don't see how we should be hamstrung by our previous claims - especially if we now find them faulty, incomplete, or inconsistent. </p><p>It seems potentially interesting to say I argue X relevant to Y but with respect to Z I don't think X holds up and here is why. It might lead to a revision of the argument X, or simply showing why Y and Z are different in kind and therefore these arguments are not inconsistent. This could help develop a coherent research program rather than detract from one, in my view. </p><p>As an early career person my challenge is not that my papers potentially disagree with each other but that I am interested in a variety of things and end up writing on some very different topics (within my broad specialization) that can make it difficult to see my research as a "coherent" "program" of research. I sometimes wish there were easier ways to put my current work in conversation with my other work.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Consistency assumes that our views are very compelling to begin with. Most people’s aren’t. Even Kant’s ideas aren’t very consistent. In fact, some people were more Kantian than him in some areas. Focus more on asking good questions and providing fruitful answers to them. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I'm familiar with OP's issue. But in my case, the worries are normally more detailed in nature. (Is the claims in this paper in a footnote consistent with the specific way I tried to side-step some issue in a previous one?) The worries are not normally big-picture ideas. </p><p>My solution so far has been: ignore it. What's the worse that could happen? A motivated graduated student publishes a paper that carefully dissects my work? That doesn't sound too bad. In fact, it sounds quite useful both professional and personally!<br/>

	</p><p>I think if the OP is really interested in how their different ideas fit together in a coherent, overarching view, they should think about working on a larger book project. But the other commenters are right that it's not as important for all your papers to be mutually coherent - while it's nice to have a cumulative research program, it's okay to think of paper-writing as a non-monotonic endeavor. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

Depending on what kind of institution or department you're at, there might be no real "onboarding" process where someone shows you all the things you need to know (from how to use the copy machine to healthcare stuff). I was at a department where I wasn't added to the relevant listservs, and for months I didn't get emails about department parties or colloquia. So you need to be really proactive about getting all the information you need, making sure you're on the right listservs, and so on.

It is a contract. And you signed it. It is imperative that you learn what you can legally do.</p><p>I agree on all counts. Different publishers can have very different policies. Some publishers allow you to post final drafts (non-copyedited, etc.) on non-profit repositories such as PhilPapers immediately upon acceptance. However, others have 'embargo periods' of a year or two post-publication during which you can post a final draft to your website, but which you have to wait to pass before you can post anything to a repository. Other publishers still do not permit <em>any</em> version of a paper to be posted to a repository, but instead only allow you to link to the actual published version at the journal. Finally, many publishers only allow posting drafts to non-profit repositories, but absolutely forbid posting drafts to for-profit sites (such as Academia.edu). </p><p>Long story short, the safe thing to do is to read (and follow) your publishing contract very carefully.

	</p><p>I always double-check the publisher's and journal's policies, which are usually referred to in the contract but not included in the document itself. They are typically very clear, if a little hard to find. Something to add to Marcus's comments is that the submitted version of the manuscript (i.e. the pre–peer review version) can usually be posted anywhere upon acceptance, but they can be less useful for publicizing your scholarship since your paper may have changed significantly during the review process.</p><p>The good news is that as soon as the editor(s) confirm acceptance of the paper, you can index it in PhilPapers (and add it to your CV as "forthcoming"), then add a copy of the manuscript when the embargo is lifted. And if anyone emails to ask for a copy of the paper, there is nothing to stop you sharing it.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Something else to add that just occurred to me: universities in some countries require manuscripts of accepted articles to be uploaded to their internal repositories as soon as possible. In the UK this is, I believe, part of their reporting obligations to the government under the research excellence framework. In cases like these, you upload the paper and let the specialists who manage the repo decide how and when to make the file publicly available.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>The safe legal thing to do is to follow the contract, whatever it says. But I have never heard of a case of a person who got in trouble for not following the contract.</p><p>I normally post on various websites a final draft, using my own formatting, in PDF form after it appears on the journal's page. I also normally download the official journal version. That way, if someone does email me, I can send the official version and not just my final PDF draft.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I don't think honouring contracts is that important, especially if we reflect upon whether the contracts are exploitative in the first place. And we should probably reconsider if we want to envoke the "you voluntarily" stuff. How much choice do we actually have, especially if we are early career academics?</p><p>I would say that we should always follow the 11th commandment: don't get caught. This, of course, would need some evidence of the general norms as they are enforced. But for my small contribution (less than 5 papers), I've posted all on PhilPapers and did my best to upload them to sci-hub. I've never heard of anyone getting into trouble.</p><p>I further believe (without argument) that we have a duty to do so, to make stuff as easily accessible as possible, as some are not from resourceful institutions.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Call me old fashioned, but I try hard to keep promises that I make.  And when a journal publishes my article--proofreads it, makes it look nice, sends it to libraries around the world, advertises it, etc., and in the process creates lots of jobs and generates a return on capital for investors--I promise, signing my name, not to disseminate it in certain ways.  So I don't.  These restrictions rarely prevent anyone who wants to read the article from doing so at no cost.  (You can post the penultimate draft on a personal webpage, e.g., or PhilPapers--just read the contract.)</p><p>It's ironic (or maybe not) that so many academics don't care about keeping their word with these private sector actors, given how actually exploitative and generally nasty 'non-profit' academia has become.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I agree with the first commenter: "free dissemination of knowledge (knowledge that the author created!) takes precedence over corporate profit."</p><p>While I'm lame and just post pre-prints myself, I always appreciate when I see another (typically more senior) philosopher has shared their post-prints on PhilPapers.  They're doing a public service, by making academic work more accessible.</p><p>fwiw, I think it's morally better to break bad promises than to keep them. (Obviously, better to avoid making such promises in the first place if you can, but if that isn't feasible for whatever reason...)  Keeping knowledge inaccessible to those without institutional access is just bad (and a violation of your duties to the public if your work is publicly funded).  Don't do it!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

I haven't even been able to secure adjuncting gigs for the fall. And I have not had any luck finding employment outside of the faculty track, either. If I go back on the market, how bad will it look that I have no affiliation and no employment for the upcoming academic year? Will that lower my chances even further?</p><p>Good questions. It's not clear from the reader's comment whether they are just out of graduate school and this past year was their first year on the job market. If so, I suspect that they will still look like someone 'just out of graduate school' and the gap on their CV won't matter much. I suspect this is especially true right now, due to the COVID pandemic. Search committee members will be well aware that candidates just out of grad school faced a uniquely horrible market this past year.</p><p>On the other hand, my sense is that the longer one is out of grad school, the more likely it is that these kinds of gaps are likely to affect one's chances. Generally speaking, my guess is that you want to look like you are 'still in the game', publishing, getting teaching experience, etc. But these are just my thoughts. <strong>What are yours? </strong>I'm especially curious to hear from people who have served on search committees.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/cv-gaps-and-the-market/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/cv-gaps-and-the-market/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>The principal reason gaps matter is that the market is so flooded that schools can afford to be choosey.

	</p><p>A gap of a year probably won't make much difference. If it persists, though, it will hurt your chances.</p><p>It is clearly not fair but, with a glut of candidates, search committees don't need to take risks. If something like a persistent unexplained gap raises a doubt, it is likely they will just move on to others in the pool. (*Explained* gaps, like having a child or caring for ailing relatives, mostly won't be held against you as long as the rest of your trajectory looks good.)</p><p>How can a candidate adapt to this? Only by doing what everyone else is doing, too: Making their c.v. as strong as possible in every other respect. Volunteer teaching, teaching for an online university, tutoring high schoolers, philosophy outreach to prisons, subbing at a high school, starting a philosophy podcast...anything to keep your teaching currency up and improve your skills. At the same time, make sure your publication record continues to improve.</p><p>That's an incredibly tall order, especially when trying to earn a living in another job.</p><p>I started by saying that a gap of a year won't make much of a difference. That's partly because every candidate's chances are low right now. It is partly because committees recognize that the market is ridiculous and will overlook a year's gap. But also, and hardest to face, is that it won't make much difference because whatever made you uncompetitive/unlucky in previous years is likely to still be the case moving forward, whether you have a gap or not. I recommend getting sympathetic senior people (in addition to your supervisor) to give you advice on your application materials. It may be that a tweak to how you present yourself (the professionalism of your c.v. and letter, how you explain your work, what AOCs you claim, etc.) could make a difference. Or it could be that you get an honest assessment of what you need to add to your c.v. to have a chance. </p><p>A great number of the candidates who didn't get the jobs we've hired for in recent years would have been absolutely excellent--and they still didn't get the jobs. So much of a search is luck and circumstances beyond the candidate's influence.<br/>

	</p><p>I learned early on in my work on search committees, mentored by a very experienced senior colleague, to look for gaps in CVs because gaps could be cause for concern.  This meant that a CV had otherwise to be very strong to merit further consideration of an applicant.  Best therefore to have no gaps and explain what you were doing, e.g., non-academic employment as X while seeking an academic position.  Given the state of the job market, no fair-minded search committee will hold this against an applicant.    </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>There may be a way to avoid the problem somewhat: I know some departments will grant unpaid "fellowships" of some kind to previous grad students in your position to help them with just this problem (and, if you are lucky, library access). You should ask your chair/supervisor about such a position to help you avoid the gap. Although I suspect that the best thing you could do is to publish papers: that is probably the strongest signal that you are still in the game.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Agree with others that gaps are especially tough in a market that can be so picky and needs to look for any reason to whittle down the pool. I disagree with Laurence Bernard McCullough though that all gaps are cause for concern and that there is a neutral way to explain gaps (i.e. people who took time out of formal education/employment for child-rearing, or who had periods of illness, caregiving duties, etc, all of which they may not want to discuss with potential employers). </p><p>As Anonymous Grad said, there are often ways to either remain a student without filing your graduation paperwork, or staying on as a paid post doc, lecturer, or visiting assistant professor in your department, or unpaid fellow (all of these are potentially exploitative and will likely undervalue the person in need of this kind of arrangement so it is not ideal, it is a workaround). I also see folks pick up a single course at a college while they work other jobs in order to keep a toe actively in academia. </p><p>I would think that committees know what current/recent PhDs are up against. Of course having an affiliation is going to be a leg up. But having continued scholarly output and strong job materials might be better than someone still technically affiliated with a program and nothing to show for it in terms of scholarship. Committees might not have to choose between these two options in an oversaturated market, but my point is that it is not only one thing (i.e. only affiliation, or only publications) likely to land someone an interview or job. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='d'>Being a philosopher in Sweden</h3><p>This is the twenty-fifth installment of <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/the-cocoon-goes-global/">The Cocoon Goes Global</a>, a series that gives a sense of what the philosophy profession looks like outside of the Anglophone West. </p><p>This guest post is written by <a href="https://www.umu.se/en/staff/sofia-jeppsson/"> Sofia Jeppsson</a>, associate professor of philosophy at Umeå University (or <em>Ubmeje Universitiähta </em>in the local Sami language) in northern Sweden.</p><p>Sweden is a country in northern Europe and part of the European Union. The surface area is slightly smaller than Spain, slightly larger than the US state of California – still, only a little over ten million people live here. Originally, Sweden consisted of only the southern 1/3 of the present-day nation. In the fourteenth century, the Swedish crown decided to colonize the north, although this went very slowly until the seventeenth century when the colonization efforts picked up some speed. The crown wanted access to metals and other natural resources up north, and to convert the Sami population to Christianity (although somewhat unusually, they explicitly wanted a diversified economy with the Sami remaining hunters, fishermen and reindeer herders, while Swedes did agriculture and mining). When Norway became independent of Sweden in 1905, this led to further oppression of the Sami; many groups were forcibly relocated, creating legal conflicts about land rights between different Sami groups that persist to this day.</p><p>Nevertheless, after all this, roughly 90 % of the Swedish population still live in the southern 1/3 of the country. I did too, until I got my current position in 2018 and moved up north.</p><p>Sweden’s oldest universities are Uppsala University founded in 1477 followed by the University of Lund in 1666, both of which persist to this day and are among the biggest universities of the country. Most universities in Sweden are run by the government, and officially counts as government agencies.</p><p>Umeå University was founded by the Swedish government in 1965, with the aim of increasing the general educational level in the north. We differ from the big universities in the south in having lots of online courses and -teaching besides what we do on campus.</p><p>Higher education in Sweden is done in either a <em>universitet </em>or a <em>högskola</em>, although both institutions are often called universities in English. (<em>Högskola</em> literally translates to high school, but should not be confused with American high schools!) The distinction used to be that a <em>högskola</em> only provided bachelor and master’s degrees, whereas an <em>universitet</em> also offered doctoral degrees and was more research focused. The differences between högskola and universitet are getting increasingly blurred as time moves on, though.</p><p>If you’re accepted as a doctoral student in Sweden, the department will hire you with a monthly salary for up to five years (with some teaching and administrative work included). You also have benefits such as a long and paid parental leave if you have a child during grad school (regardless of gender). Another difference between Swedish academic jobs and those of many other countries is that we don’t really have a tenure-track system. You’re either hired for a fixed term, or hired permanently, in which case you have high job security. Permanent positions can be either as <em>lektor </em>or <em>professor. </em>The latter is only for people who are already far advanced and accomplished in their careers. My own job title is that of <em>lektor</em>; we who have permanent lektor jobs usually call ourselves associate professors in English (as I did in the beginning of this blog post). However, it’s also possible to be hired as a lektor for a limited period of time, like 6-12 months, when the university has need of an extra teacher; the lektor position is at bottom a teaching one, even though you have some time for research too.</p><p>After defending one’s PhD thesis in Sweden, people traditionally host a big dinner and party for colleagues, family and friends. I’ve talked to American colleagues who have been invited to some such event to serve as an opponent during the thesis defence, and attended the dinner and celebration afterwards, who compared it to a wedding dinner. I think it’s an apt comparison. People give toasts, hold speeches, and present gifts to the new PhD. Furthermore, although the details differ a bit from university to university, there’s often a big yearly ceremony in town for everyone who became a PhD during the year. The new PhD’s, wearing tailcoats or evening gowns, are crowned with laurel wreaths and given rolled up documents stating (in Latin) that one has now become a Doctor of Philosophy in the name of the King (well, there’s much more text than that, but I’m honestly not certain what it says since I can’t read Latin).</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/being-a-philosopher-in-sweden/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/being-a-philosopher-in-sweden/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='e'>Tips for a first-time conference presenter?</h3><p>In our newest "<a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2021/07/how-can-we-help-you-july-2021.html">how can we help you?</a>" thread, a reader writes:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;">I have my first conference presentation coming up with a dedicated commentator.

	</p><p>Three things:</p><p>I don't use powerpoint but I do use handouts and, in my experience, the vast majority of questions in the Q&amp;A will concern something that's on the handout. (I imagine that's because audience members get the handout at the start and so have time during your talk to linger on particular claims in it and come up with a question or two.) This means that you can view creating the handout as also a way to guide the audience towards certain sorts of questions and away from others.</p><p>Don't take more than a few minutes to respond to the commentator, as that will eat into time for the Q&amp;A. You can give some preliminary responses to the commentator's questions or objections but then say that you're happy to go into more detail during the Q&amp;A if audience members ask you to do so. Sometimes they will, sometimes they won't. </p><p>I think it can be helpful to think of yourself, during the Q&amp;A, as giving a kind of performance: even if you're actually very nervous, feeling defensive at a hostile question, or whatever, you're performing being affable, intellectually curious, excited to engage with the audience, confident, etc.  (Indeed, if you perform being this kind of philosopher when responding to the commentator, you're able to set a certain kind of tone for the Q&amp;A and, I think, lessen the chances of overly aggressive questions.)</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>In partial defense of reading: Although most attendees prefer a PowerPoint/handout as opposed to reading from a paper, be sure that you can actually give a presentation without the aid of a written paper before committing to doing so. Personally, most of the lousy talks I've seen were ones where the speaker never got into the details of their arguments, presumably because they weren't prepared enough to carefully state their arguments without having those arguments written down. Those talks had the feel of 'here are some big ideas about this' and not like an actual philosophy talk. And of course, putting long texts verbatim into a visual presentation is also unacceptable. So: talk through visual aids and/or a handout if you wish, but not at the expense of content.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>One quick Q&amp;A tip: If your session has a chair, have a conversation with them before the session begins and ask them to be in charge of fielding questions and managing the queue for the Q&amp;A.  It's too much cognitive load to be keeping track of hands and thinking philosophically at the same time!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>There's a world of difference between reading out loud a paper that was written to be read by the listener (e.g. like a journal article) and reading out loud a paper that was *written specifically to be read out loud*. I think there's a lot to be said for  the latter. The danger of speaking from notes is that you will add stuff on the fly and then run out of time. Crafting a really nice written presentation -- and then sticking to it -- avoids that danger.  </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>If you can, practice your presentation in less formal environments first-- a group of friends/ colleagues, a workshopping group, etc. You might get some useful feedback or a sense of the questions you'll field, and you'll get more comfortable delivering the talk itself. This helped me a ton when I was starting out.<br/>
Sometimes, you can drop in something during the talk that invites a certain line of questioning/commentary-- you can even say "we can talk more about this in the Q&amp;A"-- and that can steer the conversation in a direction that may be more helpful and for which you'll be more prepared. <br/>
For what it's worth, I'm mid career and have never loved giving talks in general, although I've had mostly good experiences. Since I'm tenured at a school where most of my job is teaching and service, I don't feel pressure about presenting-- I've enjoyed the freedom to apply to conferences mainly on the basis of whether it will be a good experience for me, not on whether it's prestigious enough or whatever. Indeed, I've felt free to take a break from presenting altogether and focus on writing instead. I know not everyone has that freedom (I am very fortunate to be where I am) but I thought it might be helpful to know that in many jobs, you can thrive without being a fancy-conference rockstar. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>A couple questions:</p><p>(1) At my current institution, the teaching demos rarely have actual students in the audience; instead, the audience is usually just the search committee, or the search committee plus some extra faculty/grad students. Is this common? Should this make any difference to how one runs their teaching demo? And if so, how?</p><p>(2) Is it possible to be more specific about student activities? In the courses I've taught, I often break the students up into smaller groups for short discussion periods before coming back to a wider discussion with the whole class. I've found that this helps encourage participation and tends to get some voices involved that wouldn't normally be. Would this be enough? Or are we expected to run some sort of new pedagogy activity? I have to admit that I am hesitant to go in that direction because as an undergrad I always found the new pedagogy style courses to be mostly tiresome and a waste of time, and ended up going out of my way to avoid them after feeling like I didn't get much out of the ones that I had taken. (I've also heard faculty express distaste for teaching demos that get too creative.) So, it would be helpful to get some sense of what would be too little and what would be too much (I've never had the chance to attend a teaching demo myself, so I really don't know). </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I've done a few, and seen a few, too. Perhaps my take is idiosyncratic, but here we go:</p><p>Don't try to cram everything into your teaching demo. This is especially true if it's a short demo, but also true of whole classes. Content-wise, decide on a small number of things you absolutely want everyone to take away from the class, and focus on transmitting that. You don't need to give them every last detail. Also focus on showing off your methods and teaching style.</p><p>So, for example, if your demo is supposed to be half an hour on Hume's problem of induction, don't try to give them a play-by-play of Hume's argument and all of his terminology. Instead, you could start with an exercise introducing induction (I like a modified version of the game Eleusis, described in the book "Demonstrating Philosophy", but you can do anything! You could even bring in a bag of marbles or stones or whatever), and then have students offer up some examples of inductive inferences in the real world/their lives. You could distinguish inductive from deductive reasoning, and then give a broad overview of Hume's riddle, cutting to the chase (i.e. just focusing on how we know induction is justified as a method).</p><p>The demo needs to be clear and accessible, show off your classroom technique, and demonstrate how you interact with students, manage time, boil down material, field questions, explain stuff out of the blue, manage discussions, etc. It's not primarily an exercise in transmitting content, such that you have to fit in all of the content. The content is a guide for handling the rest; don't be shy about sacrificing some of it on the altar of interactive time with your classroom. Remember also that the demo, when in an actual classroom, is a chance to win over the student body, get them excited about you and your classes, etc.</p><p>And whatever you do, keep an eye on the time. Don't go over (or, if you do, don't go more than a minute or two over: show an awareness of the time, and don't start talking about the day's topic in the last few minutes because you durdled around in the preliminary details for too long).</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Michel made some great points. I would emphasize the idea that the purpose is to demonstrate your best qualities as a teacher, not to transmit information. (That said, if you make factual mistakes it will definitely count against you, so know your subject well.) I would also show some awareness that this is an artificial situation and not a real class. I found it awkward when candidates gave students a ten minute silent writing exercise before a discussion, for example--better would be to say, "In a real class, I'd give you ten minutes for this, but for today just take a minute and jot down your first thoughts." The flip side of that is that you shouldn't just lecture. It is okay to establish rapport by spending a few minutes connecting to students by telling them about your background. Committees want to see how you engage students, get them to talk, how you respond to them, how you spark them to think, etc. Rigor is fine, but it isn't usually the point: Clarity, engagement, ability to manage discussion, and things like that are much more important. Another thing to keep in mind is to teach to the audience you have. It may be that you are interviewing at an institution that does not have a graduate program, or where students may be less prepared than where you are doing your PhD. I'm not saying to "dumb it down" but rather to make sure you are reaching your audience. Generally, covering less but in depth is better than covering more.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>@Phdcandidate: There are some great tips above. You don't need to reinvent the wheel in terms of pedagogical methods. Putting students in pairs or small groups for a few minutes to discuss a question on their own is good, or giving students time to work on a small exercise, and then bringing them back to class discussion. You don't need to do tedious pedagogical acrobatics to stimulate a good discussion and to make sure that the students are not just passive listeners. I would judge these activities by how well thought out the questions or activities are the students are supposed to answer and how well they integrate into the overall lesson. It's pretty easy to tell if someone does it just because they know they are supposed to. Often, the activity will seem like a superfluous gimmick in those cases rather than an integral part of the class.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>There's a lot of good advice here so far so I won't repeat it. I will say two things one for a real class and one for the simulated one with faculty and other members of the search committee. If it's a real class then it's probably a very good idea to have a serious conversation with the person whose class you're taking over about what has come before and what he or she's trying to get across. I had one of these teaching demos once and, while the students were engaged and I still think I picked the more interesting and important things to cover from the readings, the guy whose class it was spent the whole demo looking like he was chewing nails. I'm not sure exactly what he took the point of the readings in question (the first book of Aristotle's NE) but it wasn't whatever I was talking about. Remember the person whose class you're taking over is almost certainly part of the search committee. Keeping them happy is much more important than the reactions of the actual students. (Though if they're bored to tears that's not good either). Have a very serious conversation with this person beforehand and follow their lead even if you think they're wrong. <br/>
If it's the more artificial demo I think it's good to treat it as much like a real class as you can without creating massive awkwardness. I had a demo like that in the interview for my current job and I put in a lot of gaps in for "student" questions and even called on people who looked like they wanted to say something. One search committee member took one of those "do you have any questions so far" gaps as a chance to role play some of his most annoying student questions and I really thought I'd made a horrible mistake. But later I found out this was one of the things the committee really liked about my demo. I guess a lot of the other candidates had treated this much more like a presentation at a conference or the like and only given the committee a chance for questions in a few minutes at the very end (if then) and that didn't go over well at all.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I think I had about 5 teaching demos during my time on the market, and I’ve seen about 12. The way we do them at my current institution, you take over an actual class and teach whatever you want to teach, with the last 10 minutes reserved for a student survey. Students, at least here, are usually pretty kind. In my large department, faculty definitely have different ideas of what a good class looks like and we have some old-school lecture types, so I wouldn’t ONLY do activities at a demo (I tend to teach in very discussion/activity-oriented ways, but I lectured more in my demos than I typically do). </p><p>For my own teaching demos, I was usually able to pick the topic, and usually had a real class, but the most difficult demo I ever did was in front of a large group of faculty (most of whom were not on the search committee or in the department) who were aiming to simulate a classroom; several decided it would be helpful to be deliberately obtuse or difficult. Of all of the teaching demos I’ve seen or done (which includes demos at R1s, R2s, and SLACs), that was the only one without real students and a real class that I’ve seen.</p><p>IMO, I wouldn’t necessarily follow the lead of the person whose class it is. At my institution, the class used for the demo is not usually taught by someone on the search committee (it has usually been a class taught by recurring lecturers, rather than TT faculty), and—at any rate—if you pick a text/topic that many faculty know, there will be a diversity of opinions about how it should be taught. At least at my institution, we argue passionately about the teaching.</p><p>One thing I did was bring folding name cards and asked students to write their first names on them, so I could call them by name during discussion. Yes, it took a few minutes at the beginning, but it made a difference to me that I could do that, rather than just pointing at students or say “you with the red t-shirt.”</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

We use recent work on consciousness to motivate new doubts about both sets of arguments. First, we argue that if either panpsychism or panqualityism is true, then the only way to live in a simulation may be as brains-in-vats, in which case it is unlikely that we live in a simulation. We then argue that if panpsychism or panqualityism is true, then viable simulation hypotheses are substantially sceptical scenarios.

As I mentioned in my <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/job-market-boot-camp-part-1-building-a-better-cv.html" target="_self">introduction</a>, the series will discuss all things job-market related, with the aim of helping candidates to better prepare for the academic market. As I also explained, I would like for the series--both my posts and comments--to be as evidence-based as possible. Although, again, sound evidence for how to succeed on the market is hard to come by, my hope that is by tying information and advice to evidence, rather than pure speculation, the series will actually provide readers with good information and advice to go on. So, let's try to hold each other to that. When giving information and advice, don't just give your "impressions." Try to give tangible evidence!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The topic of today's post is simple: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">how to build a strong CV that will be competitive on the market</span>. My personal experience strongly suggests that when it comes to being competitive, <strong><em>publications--publications in general, not just top-ranked publications--matter more than just about anything else</em></strong>. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">When I was in grad school, many people cautioned me (and others I knew) against publishing articles in low-ranked journals. I was told that this might lead search committees to judge you negatively, and thus, that one should only shoot for publications in top-ranked journals. My personal experience strongly suggests that this advice was mistaken.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Although I've never published in a top-20 journal, and so have no experience with whether they might "help" my candidacy, I have a lot of experience publishing in lower-ranked journals--and here my experience was unequivocal: <em>the more I published (even in low-ranked journals), the more interviews I received</em>. Indeed, the relationship was very striking. When I had few publications, I got few interviews. When I had more publications, I got more interviews. When I had a lot of publications, I got a lot of interviews. Publishing a lot, even if it's only in lower-ranked journals, appeared to help a <em>lot</em>. No, I did not receive R1 interviews. Most of my interviews were at SLACs, and a substantial minority were at R2's (which I define roughly as research universities without philosophy PhD programs). But still, when it came to SLACs and R2's, my experience was that top-ranked publications were not necessary to be competitive, and lower-ranked publications helped considerably.</p><p style="text-align: justify;"> </p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CV-Building Advice #1</span>:</strong> <strong><em>All</em> types of publications appear to help. P</strong><strong>ublish, and publish...<em>everywhere</em>--in top-ranked journals if you can, but <em>also</em> in lower-ranked journals. </strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">So much for publications. What about the rest of the CV? The sad fact is, I think it's very hard to say. Given how important teaching is at many SLACs, I think good teaching evals and a broad teaching resume--with experience teaching a lot of different classes--are both probably helpful. Further, during my interviews at SLACs, search committees and deans seemed to like student-involvement stuff quite a lot. That being said, I had a lot of teaching experience and student involvement for years, and it didn't seem to lead to interviews. What did? <em>Publications</em>. So, I would say:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">CV-Building Advice #2</span>: Try to expand your teaching resume and student involvement, and improve your student reviews--but do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> sacrifice publishing. Find a way to improve the teaching and student-engagement parts of your portfolio while continuing to publish.</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, my experience has been that it is important to secure recommendation letters from respected people outside of your graduate department--particularly the longer you're out on the market. I was not only given this advice by many different people, but also experienced positive results. Every time I got more recommendation letters from respected figures in the discipline, my interview numbers improved. So, I would say:</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>CV-building Advice #3:</strong></span><strong> It is a good idea to obtain new recommendation letters from respected members of the discipline not from your graduate program</strong>.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I will devote a future post to how to go about following this advice. But these, I guess, are my three biggest pieces of CV-building advice. Am I wrong? Have I missed anything important?

	</p><p>I agree with much of what you say, Marcus. The obsession with publications in top-ranked general philosophy journals is something of a myth, and your data appears to confirm that the effect on hiring is minor. At the very least, it shows that productivity is more important than getting published in journals whose main claim to superiority is their absurdly high rejection rate. Indeed, given that past productivity is probably the best indicator of future productivity, hiring committees would be well-advised to go by the overall track record in terms of publications, rather than by ranking candidates according to the highest-ranking journal that each candidate has published in. I would add one caveat, however, to your recommendation to "Publish, and publish...everywhere--in top-ranked journals if you can, but also in lower-ranked journals." The caveat is so obvious that I'm sure everyone will agree: students should be advised AGAINST publishing in dubious venues such as journals that charge publication fees (even if they claim to be 'open access') or in journals that lack peer review and editorial oversight. Some of these predatory journals engage in sophisticated email campaigns, inviting submissions on the basis of conference presentations etc. -- some students may be flattered by such personalized invitations, but a publication in such a journal, in my opinion, would be a 'kiss of death' as far as one's chances with hiring committees is concerned.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>@ Axel-</p><p>I would add (for those who do not already know) that you can check whether a low-ranked journal is actually a predatory journal via Beall's List: <a href="http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/." rel="nofollow">http://scholarlyoa.com/publishers/.</a> This list was invaluable to me after I started getting bombarded with emails from these journals.</p><p>On a positive note, I really like the push for open access, since I do not think that the high cost of journals is necessary (as we philosophers do basically all the work: submitting, refereeing, editing...(well, not always proof-editing)). There are a number of journals that are doing great things for the profession (Philosopher's Imprint, Thought, and Ergo come to mind). Does anyone know of a list of reputable open access journals? Perhaps we could start one (and maybe call it the Cocoon List?).</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='i'>Tailoring your job-market strategy to your situation</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Long-time readers of the Cocoon may recall that I've wondered on a few occasions whether many academic job-candidates end up adopting a sub-optimal job-market strategy. First, last year <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2018/01/grad-program-rank-publications-and-job-market-a-hypothesis.html">I floated a hypothesis</a> that job-candidates coming out of lower-ranked PhD programs may have a tendency to adopt a job-market strategy that fails to make them competitive for R1 jobs (since top-ranked programs fare best with those) while simultaneously 'pricing them out' of teaching-focused jobs. Second, I've often <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2012/05/the-long-game-in-defense-of-publishing-in-bad-journals.html">floated the idea</a> that one fairly common piece of conventional wisdom--that publishing in low-ranked or no-name journals 'looks bad on the market'--is just <em>false</em> when it comes to jobs at teaching schools. My clear sense, both as a job-candidate for many teaching jobs and (more recently) as a search-committee member at a liberal arts university, is that a lot of people at these kinds of institutions could <em>really care less</em> about journal rankings. And, as luck would have it, <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2019/05/evidence-that-weak-publications-help-candidates.html?fbclid=IwAR1S91Q0G1BmdiXAH9-d5RQzhQKLz2lXLlnei5cHm26qgyvBqo0Q-RC4C-Y">a recent study</a> appears to bear out my skepticism: publications in 'weak journals' appear to <em>help</em>, at least if you publish in good places too.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, a recent exchange I had with a friend got me thinking this morning about a more general issue: namely, the potential importance of <strong>tailoring your job-market strategy to a realistic picture of your 'situation'</strong> . Allow me to explain.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/tailoring-your-job-market-strategy-to-your-situation/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/tailoring-your-job-market-strategy-to-your-situation/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>Regarding point 2: Doesn't this put some lower-ranked PhD students at a disadvantage for eventually getting a job? For example, my lower-ranked program only requires PhD students to teach about 6-8 courses during their PhD, but there are some (minimal) opportunities to teach more. These are a mix of intro-level classes and maybe two specialized classes in order to get teaching experience in one's AOSs. If lower-ranked grads need more teaching experience in order to land a teaching job, this might force some of us to adjunct at other universities simply for more experience.</p><p>However, given the advice previously posted on the Cocoon that candidates need to prove their AOCs by teaching courses in those areas, this creates a tension. Most universities need adjuncts for intro-level classes, so grad students in the situation I described earlier might not be able to fill out their AOCs with teaching experience in all the areas they might actually be competent in.</p><p>How can this tension be resolved?<br/>
(a) Petitioning one's program for more teaching opportunities across the board.<br/>
(b) Publishing articles in one's AOCs in lower-ranked journals to prove competence.<br/>
(c) Claiming an AOC that you might not be able to prove competence in based on teaching or publications.<br/>
(d) Hoping for the best in getting a temporary position after the PhD that will fill in the gaps.<br/>
(e) Something else?</p><p>I worry about (a) not being feasible in many cases. (b) might make the candidate look like they have too diverse of interests and are not really specializing in anything. (c) seems like it could backfire, so (d) might be the best option for this case. Is there anything I might be overlooking which can resolve the tension?</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I probably don't know as much about this as Marcus, but I get the sense that teaching schools care most about:</p><p>1. Solo teaching experience (i.e. lead instructor, not the TA)<br/>
2. Solo teaching experience at an institution like the hiring institution.</p><p>While a mix of teaching, and teaching in AOC is very helpful, it is not as helpful as the above two things. I think adjunct experience is critical for those who want teaching jobs, since rarely do PhD students get (1) and (2) at their own institution. PhD institution are typically R1s - so if you want to get hired by a state or liberal arts school, or CC, you need to teach outside of your PhD institution. </p><p>I would gain experience in your AOC another way, and adjunct, given your circumstance. No situation is perfect, and sometimes  the best CV requires post PhD experience. </p><p>I would add to the above, that the whole "top 5-10" journal thing is heavily biased toward certain areas of philosophy. If you work in a niche area R1s won't require top 5-10 publications, at least not that general ranking you see all the time. They require you to publish in top journals in your area. Also, being a name in your field is even more important than the straight up journal publishing record. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Grad Student H:</p><p>My sense is that if you're teaching 6-8 courses as a solo instructor during your time as a PhD student that's a lot more than most "highly ranked" Phd students get to teach. At the extreme, some students at highly ranked programs get to teach maybe only 1 or 2 solo courses. So you're already at a big advantage (for teaching jobs) over those candidates.</p><p>But I'd be curious if anyone has done a systematic survey of how much solo teaching one does as a graduate student. I bet grad students at elite (philosophy) Phd public schools get more opportunity than students at elite private grad programs. And I bet less well ranked programs often have more opportunities because (1) the school is less wealthy and so there's less fellowship money and (2) the school is less wealthy and so they'd rather have more poorly paid graduate students teach than expensive faculty.  But I haven't systematically studied this, and I'm relying just on info about a few programs of each type, where the pattern seems to hold.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I have seen that highly ranked programs typically not only offer far more funding for teaching free years, but that they often actively discourage teaching. So I'd be surprised if there wasn't a clear trend toward less teaching at higher ranked programs, with a few exceptions here and there.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='e'>Job-Market Boot Camp, Part 3: The CV Itself</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">In <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/job-market-boot-camp-part-2-building-a-good-cv.html" target="_self">Part 2</a> of the Cocoon's <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/job-market-boot-camp/" target="_self">Job-Market Boot Camp</a>, I wrote about how to put together a strong, competitive CV. What I'd like to do today is talk about the CV itself: how it should be formatted, organized, what should be included, what shouldn't be, etc.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When it comes to most of these issues, it is very hard to get clear evidence of "what works" and "what doesn't." Accordingly, I will base the suggestions I provide below the best evidence I have:</p><p>If you think the suggestions I provide are incorrect, or that I've left important stuff out, please do feel free to say so! </p><p>Here, then, is what I think I've learned about writing/organizing a CV:</p><p><strong>Formatting: </strong>Everyone I've ever talked to has advised against unnecessarily "flashy" CV formatting. The aim, I've been told, is not to have your CV's formatting stand out, but to the CV's content do the talking.</p><p><strong>AOS:</strong> My understanding on what you should list as an AOS has always been a bit fuzzy, but I think the safest way to understand it is in terms of your area(s) of <span style="text-decoration: underline;">demonstrated</span> research expertise. So, if you're a new PhD with no publications, the only area in which you have <em>demonstrated</em> research expertise is the area of your dissertation. Aside from that, my understanding is that you should only list other area(s) as an AOS if you have both (A) an actual publication record in the area, and (B) a reasonable claim to make that you will <em>continue</em> publishing in that area. In other words, you shouldn't list as an AOS things you merely "consider yourself an expert in." Aside from your dissertation area, you should only list as an AOS areas that <span style="text-decoration: underline;">someone looking at your CV</span> would be likely to think to themselves, "Yes, this person has demonstrated the ability to publish in this area, and do it more than just a few times." (Am I off here?) In any case, I have heard many people say to beware of listing too many AOS, or AOS that are a "reach" (it may make you look self-deceived).</p><p><strong>AOC:</strong> My understanding on AOC is even fuzzier, but the rule of thumb I've always been told is to list something as an AOC only if you plausibly have enough background in the area to teach an upper-level undergraduate seminar. For example, suppose you're a new graduate and do not have a research program in philosophy of science, but you took quite a few advanced philosophy of science courses in grad school (e.g. general philosophy of science, philosophy of biology, philosophy of physics, etc.). Okay then, in that case one can make a plausible case for listing that as an AOC. You can probably also list something as an AOC if you've published a few articles in the area, but don't have a long-term research program (Note: it's not exactly clear to me how long one can lean on graduate coursework, though. If you graduated a half-dozen years ago and you've never done research in phil science since grad school, can/should you still list it as an AOC? I'm inclined to think not). Finally, I have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">also</span> come across a great many people who have cautioned against listing too many AOC--the claim being that it can make a candidate look either self-deceived or desperate, or both.</p><p><strong>Employment:</strong> Skip this is you're a new graduate (or ABD). However, if you <em>have</em> been academically employed, list all of your positions, and list whether they are tenure-track or non-tenure-track. <em>Don't</em> skip this, or try to obscure the real nature of your position by omitting potentially relevant details. I learned this the hard way. Although the position that I'd been in (until accepting a TT position this year) was non-tenure-track, I initially did not put this in my CV, as my official title was simply "Assistant Professor" (not Visiting Assistant Professor, or some such). I later learned that although I was just trying to be honest and list my official title, it confused some people. You don't want to confuse search-committee members or cause them to think you're trying to hide something!</p><p><strong>Education:</strong> You should list your PhD year (or expected graduation date), as well as your dissertation title and dissertation committee members. I have also been advised that if you are a new graduate with few/no publications, it can be a <em>very</em> good idea to include a brief (several sentence at most) dissertation summary just below your dissertation title--the purpose being to "put your best foot forward", drawing the search committee members' to your <em>awesome</em> dissertation before they get to the fact that you don't have (any/many) publications yet. </p><p><strong>General organization of the CV: </strong>I've heard from some people that after listing your AOS/AOC, education, you may want to organize your CV according to the job-type you're applying for--for instance, research first then teaching for research jobs, but the other way around for teaching jobs. I don't know anyone who has tried this, but I will say this: I <em>always</em> put my research first, have been a productive researcher, and it did not seem to harm my chances at all with teaching schools (the vast majority of my interviews over the past few years were at teaching schools, including a few community colleges). </p><p><strong>Publications:</strong> My understanding is that it is best to clearly distinguish each type of publication in its own section. Peer-reviewed publications should be in their own section of your CV, non-peer-reviewed publications in their own section, book reviews in their own section (or at least clearly marked as book reviews), etc. You may of course list as "forthcoming" any articles that have been officially accepted, and you <span style="text-decoration: underline;">may</span> list "conditional acceptances" as a publication (though this is kind of a grey area). Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> list articles in "revise-and-resubmit" under your publications (they're not published or forthcoming), and definitely do not list articles merely under review under your publications. Instead, see below...</p><p><strong>Manuscripts under review:</strong> After your publications, it is generally a good idea to list articles presently under review at peer-reviewed journals. Do not bother listing <em>where</em> they are under review, unless they are in "revise-and-resubmit." Anyone can submit an article to the <em>Journal of Philosophy</em> or <em>Philosophical Review</em>. Since submitting an article to a great journal is not an accomplishment, listing that you've done so, as I understand it, looks awkward and a bit desperate. You <em>may</em> list list where you have a revise-and-resubmit, though, because that <em>is</em> an accomplishment (shoot, if I had an R-n-R at <em>Phil Review</em>, I'd list it in a heartbeat!). </p><p><strong>Manuscripts in preparation:</strong> It may be a good idea to list substantially completed manuscripts, as this can be an indication of how productive you are. The important thing is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not to exaggerate</span>. You should only list papers for which, at minimum, you have a complete, decent draft. A general rule of thumb is: if a search committee asked for a copy of the paper, would you (A) have it on hand to send them immediately, and (B) not be embarrassed by its condition. </p><p><strong>Conference and Invited Presentations:</strong> After your publications and manuscripts in preparation, it is standard practice to list your conference presentations. Because APA presentations are generally considered more prestigious (or so I hear) than other conferences, I suggest assigning them their own section of your CV (viz. "APA presentations"). Also, if you have had any <span style="text-decoration: underline;">invited</span> presentations (e.g. job talks, etc.), those should be up front too. </p><p><strong>Awards, Professional Service, Etc.:</strong> Generally speaking, it seems to be common practice to leave teaching stuff after any and all other categories. So, what other categories might come after listing presentations? Well, things like awards, professional service, etc. are good to list. If you've been a journal referee, list the journal(s) you refereed for as well as the <em>year</em> you were asked to do so.</p><p><strong>Teaching:</strong> List all of the classes you have taught, including the institution and year you taught them. (Is there anything else people put here?)</p><p><strong>Graduate Coursework:</strong> As I understand it, if you are a new grad/ABD student--especially one without much teaching experience--it may be helpful to list all of your graduate courses, their instructor(s), and the grades (?) you received. This will give the search committee a better idea of what you might be well-prepared to teach, and indeed, how broad your grad school preparation was. </p><p><strong>Professional References: </strong>It is my understanding that if you are coming straight out of grad school, it is okay for your only letter-writers to be your grad school professors. However, the grad students I knew who did the best on the market almost always had outside letters (they were people <em>very</em> good at networking). This can be very helpful, I've heard, because search committees expect glowing letters from one's grad school professors (your professors, after all, generally have a vested interest in you getting a job). Thus, if you want to distinguish yourself, getting a reference-letter from a well-known person in the profession outside of your department can look really good. It's also good--or so I've heard--to have more than one teaching letter for teaching jobs (though I myself never had more than one). Finally, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everyone</span> I have ever spoken to with any experience in these matters has told me that the <em>longer</em> you've on the market, the more important it is to get outside letters by well-known people. My final year on the market (this year), I had eight letters total: three grad school professors, one by my current department chair, and four by well-known people in the profession. Although it is hard to tease out causal influences, I did see a clear trend: the more outside letters I got, the more interviews I got. I'll dedicate a future post to this very topic--how to get outside letter-writers--but for now let me say this. You want to make sure that all of your letters are <em>good </em>and <em>up-to-date</em>. Ask your letter writers if they could write a positive letter supporting your candidacy, and see what they have to say. I have never once had someone be dishonest with me--and yes, I have had someone tell me that they could only write a lukewarm letter.</p><p>Am I off on anything? Did I leave anything out? I'd love to hear from job candidates and search committee members what their experiences have been.

	</p><p>Including a section "manuscripts under review" I think would be appropriate for a candidate fresh out of grad school, though perhaps an exception can (should?) be made for R&amp;Rs and conditional acceptances at impressive journals (Marcus's semi-proverbial "R&amp;R at Phil Review" springs to mind...). And I think it's important to note -- since there seems to be some confusion among graduate students on this -- that "forthcoming" means the final version of an article/chapter has been accepted and is scheduled for publication. It is NOT a euphemism for "I have this paper and am pretty confident that one day it will see the light of day". -- The advice on AOS/AOC strikes me as very relevant; it's important to be able to 'tell a story'. So 'AOC' should mean a little bit more than that one would be able to teach an intro module on it, even if it does not require having published extensively in the area. (On the topic of AOS I have a -- somewhat amusing -- post coming up...)</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>As a beginning graduate student I have a question. When applying for jobs do you routinely give (or get asked to give) your marks for individual graduate courses taken? Do you submit a transcript  in the same way as you submit an undergraduate degree transcript when applying to graduate school? </p><p>I ask this question because it's relevant when considering which graduate courses to take: should you play it safe and take courses you know you'll get good grades in, or do you experiment and take courses you might do poorly in?

Whatever you do,  do not choose courses in graduate school merely because you can get good grades.  Take the courses (i) on topics that will aid you with writing your dissertation, and (ii) with people who have the greatest reputation in your department.  Let me explain the latter point given that it is apt to be misunderstood.  I am assuming the faculty in your department with the greatest reputation have earned it.   They have published papers or books that are well regarded by other experts in the field.  A letter from such a person will count for so much more than a letter from someone who is less engaged in research, and who may not even be known off your campus.  Grades are indicators, and what you describe is a form of gaming the system.  But it will backfire.  Indeed, the reason to take courses from the reputable faculty is not to game the system, but to learn how to research from people who are well respected in the field.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Craig,</p><p>I entirely agree with "some thoughts." Taking easy classes for good grades is the last thing you want to do in grad school. Your main task in grad school should to become the best philosopher you can be. That requires taking courses that challenge you, even if you don't get the best grades. Search committees won't care how good your grades are if your body of work isn't very good. Similarly, they won't hold a few bad grades against you if, by the time you graduate, you are doing awesome work.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>HGM: Yes, it is fine to not have sections on scholarships or research funding. You should only have sections on things you have! Fwiw, I never had a scholarship *or* research funding, and it did not seem to hinder my candidacy for US jobs. I have heard, however, that these things are important for jobs in Europe--but I don't really know the European market well.</p><p>In terms of years of convocation/receiving degrees, it is my understanding that, yes, you are expected to have that on your CV. It may be susceptible to biases and ageism, but unfortunately it can also indicate job-relevant factors, such as how long it took you to finish your PhD (which can be indicative of productivity, etc.).</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>HGM,<br/>
Do not have a heading for scholarships and funding if there is nothing to list.  Do not list manuscripts under review or even revise and resubmits.<br/>
Also, do not hide dates (like graduation dates).  It looks deceptive, and it will inevitably raise a flag (usually a red one).  If committees smell deception, they will run from you.  There are more than enough qualified applicants (even for VAPs), so you must come across as honest.  Better still, BE HONEST.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

Leave off "grad stuff" when it becomes obsolete.  For example, if you publish a few papers from your dissertation, likely some of the first publications you will have, then I think a summary of your dissertation is unnecessary.  If after a few years you have no publications, and you still have your dissertation summary there, then it says something about your career, and your prospects.  Similarly, after teaching full time for a year or two, it is unnecessary to list courses that you were a teaching assistant for.<br/>
You do not need to list job talks as invited presentations.  I do not expect to see them when I look at a c.v.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hi A: I'd be curious to hear what others say, but I'm strongly inclined to say one should leave undergraduate accomplishments off one's CV. Search committees are looking to hire an advanced professional, and so are looking for achievements indicative of professional excellence. Since undergraduate achievements occur long before one's life as a professional philosopher (which only grad school trains you for), I suspect undergrad accomplishments will look irrelevant at best.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='C'>Job-Market Boot Camp, part 29: common mistakes with CVs</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Now that we have discussed some common mistakes candidates can make with <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/job-market-boot-camp-part-27-common-mistakes-with-teaching-statements.html">teaching statements</a>, <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/job-market-boot-camp-part-28-common-mistakes-with-teaching-portfolios.html">teaching portfolios</a>, and <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/job-market-boot-camp-part-26-common-mistakes-with-research-statements.html">research statements</a>, let's talk about CVs. It might seem pretty hard to mess up a CV, and to a certain extent I think this is right. Insofar as CVs basically just list a person's accomplishments, there may not that much to mess up. Still, allow me to share what I take to be a few common mistakes, and then open things up for discussion:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px; text-align: justify;"><strong>Listing papers under review as 'publications':</strong> I haven't seen many candidates do this, but seemingly every year I <em>hear</em> of candidates who do it (either because they say so on a blog somewhere, or from other search committee members). So I think it is important to discuss. Here is my general sense. There are a few 'kisses of death' that job-candidates can make--things that can potentially sink their candidacy immediately. This is one of them. Articles under review, or even in revise-and-submit, are <em>not</em> publications, and should under no circumstances be listed under that heading in a CV. Even if you note in parentheses that the article is "under review" or in "revise-and-resubmit", lising them under <em>Publications </em>can still come across either as misleading or obtuse, or both. Neither one of these things is a good look for a job-candidate. The only things that should be listed as publications are actual or forthcoming (i.e. accepted) publications. Finally, athough maybe some might disagree, I imagine that 'conditional acceptances' are okay to list as publications--but in that case it sure as heck better be a real conditional acceptance, not a revise-and-resubmit with minor revisions (there is a huge difference!), and you had better note explicitly that it is a conditional-accept. Job-candidates should stay away from putting anything in a CV that has even a whiff of dishonesty. Which brings me to...</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/job-market-boot-camp-part-29-common-mistakes-with-cvs/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2019/07/job-market-boot-camp-part-29-common-mistakes-with-cvs/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>One thing that wasn’t mentioned here is CV formatting.</p><p>If one CV’s information is much more easily digested by SC committee members than another because of its formatting, then the candidate with the CV with better formatting might have an advantage because easy digestion might lead to easier recall of one’s accomplishments.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Formatting: Good point. CVs packed with too much information (e.g. details about particular courses taught or lists of duties at past positions) can be off-putting. Simple, clean CVs with traditional formatting are I think the way to go.</p><p>Consistency with formatting may also be important. For example, inconsistent font-size changes or indentations can look sloppy. Spelling and editing (including consistent punctuation) may also be important. These are small things, but I think they go for dossiers in general: you want to look like you really have your act together, demonstrating care and conscientiousness.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Fwiw, I'm not sure I agree about the importance of distinguishing peer-reviewed and non-peer reviewed publications on a CV. It's not because I don't think the distinction matters, or because I don't think search committees will care, but just that I think it's clear enough from the publication venues. Or, in the rare cases where it's not, it's because the venue is obscure enough that search committee members don't recognize it, in which case the distinction is less important; a peer-reviewed publication in a journal search committee members won't carry lots of weight just in virtue of being peer reviewed.  </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Daniel: My sense is that people at R1s care a great deal about journal names, but people at more teaching institutions may not care much at *all* about whether they recognize a journal. What people at teaching institutions (in my experience) care more about is whether a person publishes enough peer reviewed articles simpliciter to get tenure at their institution. This is why I think candidates are best off clearly distinguishing each type of publication. It may not matter much either way for R1 jobs (which care about prestige of venue)—but it may matter for non-R1 jobs, where people care more about peer-review per se.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I think formatting is incredibly important. Mainly make your CV as easy to read and understand as possible. Leave no room for confusion, and no room for the search committee to have to look twice to understand something.</p><p>similar  to listing non publications as publications (but, not as bad) - is to have the heading "Papers" and to to list publications, articles under review, drafts, etc. This is BAD. Almost all search committee members want to see a section clearly labeled "publications." This sort of thing, unsurprisingly seems most often done by persons with only one or maybe two publications. Trust me, you aren't fooling anyone. And if you don't mean to be fooling anyone, it will still look like you are trying.</p><p>For some reason I have noticed a number of CVs of recent grads who will list something before their publications. Often it is awards, but sometimes I see teaching or I've even seen presentations! Your CV should have your current and past employment, your education, and then your publications. I think the only exception would be a community college (where you might put teaching first), or perhaps a small teaching college where you have inside information that they don't care about research. The vast majority of schools, even teaching schools, will want to see publications. </p><p>I partly disagree with Marcus about separating peer review publications. First, whether people think peer review is a special different standard varies widely. I have heard all sorts of opinions on this. At research schools, especially, there is a decent chunk of people who think invited articles are just as good as peer reviewed ones. Depending on  what your publication list looks like, separating the publications may just be a bad strategic move because it will only cause those who *do* value peer review more highly to immediately notice which work they can discount. And it won't help with those who like these articles. Second, lots of people will stretch the definition of peer review. I have seen people include both invited  journal articles and invited book chapters under "peer review" because someone did, in fact, read the paper and offer feedback - even though the odds of acceptance was like 98%. So in this case separating them seems to just advantage either the connected or those willing to stretch the truth/mislead.Lastly, it is common for established, professional, people to not separate articles on their CV, so there is at least not vast social agreement about this issue.</p><p>That said,  separating reviews from other publications is more important Not doing that has a good chance of pissing people off. You might get away with it if you have 10 articles in great places and one review. But if you have four "publications" and one is a review, it does *not* look good to list the together.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Daniel: once you get to 10+ publications (and there are now plenty of people on the market with that kind of track record), presenting them all in a single list and expecting search committees to sort through them to see which ones are peer-reviewed, which ones are book chapters, etc., would be asking them to engage in a moderately time-consuming task. It seems strategically wise to make it easy on them.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>R - that might be true, but there are other ways to divide them. You can divide them by year of publication, by subject area, by inter-disciplinary work vs pure philosophy, by single-authored vs co-authored (but see below), by invited and non-invited (which is not necessarily the same as peer review and non-peer review).</p><p>Anyway - I think job candidates should avoid doing something that will cause certain search committee members to see their work as less valuable. I have seen the following sort of thing happen:</p><p>1. Search committee members immediately dismiss any co-authored paper as "not a real publication"</p><p>2. Seen the same dismissal of articles that are in invited journals, anthologies, special issues of journals, books edited by the CV holder, and even reply articles. </p><p>3. Dismiss anything that was published in a non-philosophy journal (even if it was a top journal of another discipline)</p><p><br/>
Here is the reason why I think it is a bad strategic move to separate these things, even thought I am typically huge on making things easy to read. If they are separated, a significant number of search committees will simply ignore papers that are co-authored and/or not in peer review journals.  They will not, for instance, even bother to read the title or the venue. This can hurt a candidate, because if everything had been listed together, the search committee member would have been more likely to notice the title, venue etc. And sometimes they might *like* the title. They might say, "well such and such wasn't a peer reviewed article, but it does sound like part of a really interesting project and the venue is at least respected..." </p><p>Anyway, I could be wrong about what creates the best odds, but I have never seen a search committee member get annoyed that peer review articles were not separated from other articles (unless the list also included reviews and popular publications, which  I agree should have separate sections.)</p><p>Lastly, even if someone has 15 publications, it doesn't take that long to glance down at the title and venue, so I am not sure it is much extra work for search committee members. It is not the same as, for instance, including one or two extra pages of teaching or research statements, or having confusing headings where it is unclear what something means. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Some other more minor mistakes:</p><p>Padding - including information on your CV that is not traditional and not particularly relevant. Unless someone is straight dishonest, padding will rarely kill a candidate, but it can hurt them some, perhaps most by making their CV look more cluttered than it needs to be, and can make a candidate look desperate,  immature, or out of touch. Here are some examples of padding:</p><p>1.Including *undergraduate* awards/accomplishments on your CV. (really, really prestigious things like  graduating in the top 1% of your undergrad class might be an exception)<br/>
2.Including your GPA<br/>
3.Including days where you "guest lectured" (substitute taught) for a professor at your own PhD institution<br/>
4.including presentations at your own PhD institution's graduate seminars.<br/>
5 including all graduate seminars 2 our more years post graduation (an exception might be if you needed prove you have a speciality relevant to the particular job add)<br/>
6. Including times you *chaired* a conference session. </p><p>While this might be controversial, after a certain point I don't think you should include every conference presentation you ever did. This often just results in the more meaningful presentations getting lost among the ones that will never help.</p><p>Another mistake: Listing names of awards and providing absolutely no context. If you write down "University's X's Smith Johnston Award," it will be meaningless to most. So unless the award is well recognized and/or obvious from the title, a brief explanation is often appropriate. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Regarding the comment on lying, I strongly disagree with Marcus's assessment. Lying on CV's is the status quo. You have to be careful what you lie about of course, as some lies will get you in big trouble no doubt; for example, don't lie about where you did your PhD. However, lies in the form of exaggeration are common. If you gave a guest lecture, put down "co-taught" instead. If you have a publication that was really just handed to you by a friend, put it under publications next to your article in Synthese. If you were 12th author on a grant that brought in 100k dollars, list it on your CV as money YOU obtained. Lies of omission are just as common as exaggeration: If half your publications are only due to your connections, omit this fact entirely from your CV. Exaggerate and omit where necessary to make it sound like you're an expert in whatever subject is required at the time, regardless of whether you are. These lies of exaggeration and omission are normal and your competition will most certainly practice them. Honesty is not the right approach if you want to get a job. I guess a way to put it is this: don't outright and obviously lie but don't be overly honest either. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I have to confess to being pretty shocked by postdoc's comment. I don't think lying on CVs is the status quo. People can of course choose to do the kinds of things that postdoc describes--but in my view they are risks not worth taking. You never know how a lie or exaggeration might be discovered. You may write that you 'co-taught' course, and unbeknownst to you, one of your letter-writers notes that you merely guest-lectured. If a search-committee member catches that (and in my experience they catch all kinds of unexpected things), your candidacy may be done. And you should definitely *not* omit publications from your CV. At many institutions, once you are hired you will be expected to upload complete CV's each year as a record of your accomplishments. If it comes out at any point--in annual reviews, pre-tenure review, or tenure and promotion--that you were dishonest in any way on your CV (and you would be surprised at how resourceful people are in checking things), best of luck to you in keeping your job. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I'm with Marcus here. I would be honest, through and through. Add to everything Marcus said that philosophy is small and chatty.</p><p>Moreover, I think you're facing a dilemma. Either this stuff barely matters, in which case why do it, or it does, and if you make it past CV-reading stage you're likely to get asked about it. What're you gonna do then? Lie the rest of your career? I know I would ask people for more about any significant grants they had gotten, and now you're either going to have to deflate my impression of you at the in-person stage, or you're going to have to really make things worse.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Another thing that bothers me about postdoc's comment is the overall attitude toward the job-market that it seems to suggest--an attitude which in my experience is commonly expressed on job-market blogs: that the job-market is or should be a 'CV-pissing-contest' where the person with the best CV gets the job.</p><p>Let's be clear about something: hiring committees don't merely care about your accomplishments. They also care about the kind of *person* they are hiring. If you are the kind of Machiavellian person who lies, exaggerates, and flouts norms of propriety, what kind of employee or colleague are you likely to be? Departments and administrators care very much about hiring people who do things the right way--who don't take serious risks that might result in disciplinary proceedings or bring shame on the university. You had better believe that people don't want to hire people who lie on a CV--and I think chances are that if you are a liar or exaggerator, these things are likely to come out at some point: either in a Skype interview, fly-out to campus, or whatever. Trust me, search committee members observe candidate behavior very closely to look out for 'red flags'. Character matters...a lot. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I've been on multiple hiring committees, and the kind of behavior postdoc describes would sink candidates at my (R1) school. If we didn't notice it at the evaluating applications stage, we would definitely notice it at the interview stage, as Craig points out, unless somehow the person in question was (a) lucky that none of the discrepancies were brought to our attention by any other part of the application (e.g. letters)/word of mouth/internet hunting/whatever and (b) an extremely good and consistent liar. </p><p>That said, I just want to register that I rarely see candidates for our jobs separating peer-reviewed from non peer-reviewed publications on their cvs--maybe people with a lot of publications or who are at an advanced stage (e.g. currently going up for tenure), but I'd say for an assistant professor job only about 10%ish of cvs do this? So whatever you think about it, it seems like the norm to not separate them at the junior level. Which makes it hard for me to see how anyone could hold it against a candidate for not doing so. I also agree with Amanda that there might be pragmatic reasons not to separate them. So I'm in sum total not sure at all that I agree with Marcus about this. </p><p>One other point, not so much about lying but about consistency: it's really important to make sure that your cv is consistent with what you say in other documents (e.g. research statement, teaching statement) and also with what your letters say. I've noticed a ton of inconsistencies between these things. Usually they don't rise to the level of making me think people are lying, just being sloppy or trying to hard to "fit" their application to the job in e.g. a tailored research statement or cover letter that is not borne out by their c.v. (or the opposite). </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>anon: I think that can be a good category. I have it on my CV, and think it is informative. However, I only include substantial essays (e.g. a magazine article), not things like blog posts. Going overboard including things you have written for a public audience (e.g. Medium posts and the like) may run a risk of making you not look like a serious researcher.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>postdoc: I don't think anyone here is naive about that.</p><p>First, most of us are well aware that recommendation-letter writers tend to exaggerate, at least in the sense of potentially overstating a candidate's promise. It's well known that letters of recommendation tend to be 'inflated', much like grade inflation--and for this reason I know people who don't put much stock in recommendation letters. What recommendation letters don't typically do--as far as I can tell--is lie outright about a candidate's actual career accomplishments. (Yes, I know some people have candidates write their own letters, but (A) I wonder how common this really is, and (B) people again take recommendation letters with a serious grain of salt for this and many other reasons).</p><p>Second, I think many of us know there are candidates out there who lie or exaggerate. I personally knew someone who *lost their tenure-track job* because they lied on their CV (they are now no longer in the profession). People on hiring committees are aware that people lie: in materials, and in interviews. This can lead people on search committees to do their due diligence before hiring someone--for example, by looking up online whether their actual accomplishments match their claimed ones, as well as through phone references (which search committees may be required to complete before extending an offer). As for your point about lie detectors and whatnot, sure, search committees might be as fallible as anyone in detecting problems of character--but...ahem, let's not be naive here: they may be very much on the lookout for things a candidate says and does that might raise a red flag as to the person's character. And candidates may very well may let things slip in conversation that suggest that they are not trustworthy.</p><p>Anyway, I never suggested there aren't liars and cheats out there. Sadly, I know as well as anyone that there are. All I indicated was that I am shocked that anyone actually thinks it's normal or a good idea. People sometimes wonder why they don't get interviewed or hired after an interview. If you lie in your materials, that very well could be the reason. And, in any case, as I and others here have pointed out, it's a serious risk if you *do* get hired--as there have been more people fired from faculty jobs for this reason than just the person I knew.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>postdoc, it seems like the lies of actual import are lies that could be easily detected through a quick internet search (e.g., lies about your publications, or lies about how many authors were on a piece of writing). I really doubt that people are lying about this kind of stuff as much as you think they are. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>It's not very hard to check up on the kinds of things people put on their c.v.s--especially if they actually matter. One candidate for a job at my university lied about having a book contract at a major press. For various reasons some of us were suspicious of this. It turned out the candidate had had a verbal conversation with an editor from the press in which the editor had expressed interest in seeing sample chapters and a proposal, but the candidate had not yet submitted those or gotten a contract. It took about five minutes of work for us to find this out--all we had to do was have the person in the dept. who was friends with that editor ask them. </p><p>Yes, of course, you might not be suspicious of the right people or whatever. But I really think postdoc is exaggerating how much deception there is on the market. </p><p>Also I just want to re-emphasize what Marcus said about your cv being just one small piece of the puzzle. No one wants to hire a crappy person. Don't lie or exaggerate on your cv.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Guys, you obviously don't lie about things that can be easily looked up, unless you have plausible deniability. You can't get away with BIG lies. But don't fool yourselves! Lots of little lies, exaggerations, and omissions add up to make a big difference. </p><p>Things people regularly lie about. </p><p>1. Student Evals. At most universities I've been at they lost the official files entirely or totally failed to keep official files. So, there would be no way to check anything. </p><p>2. Teaching responsibilities. As long as the higher ups are in on it, there is no way to check what you really did or didn't do. They are often happy to fib for you. </p><p>3. Exaggerate importance in projects. People are unlikely to out someone they've worked with for exaggerating, because they depend on this person. </p><p>4. Exaggerate connections. Maybe you've just had a few email exchanges with famous person X, but make it sound like you've got a real connection.</p><p>5. Exaggerate your abilities. Maybe you don't know much about X or Y, but you can pretend. Do some research and be prepared. In my experience people don't push you too much. Usually if you seem confident and knowledgable then that's enough. </p><p>6. Omit facts about your publications. Many connected people get a ton of papers due to their connections. These papers involve almost no peer review. Don't list these publications in a separate category. Pretend they are equivalent to the peer reviewed papers you have. As others have noted, this lie of omission is common. </p><p>7. Omit facts that would make you look less amazing. That grant you helped get, that you listed as "grant money obtained," don't mention that you had almost no role. Omitting and exaggerating go hand in hand of course. Exaggerate wherever you can. </p><p>8. Pretend you're really excited to live at location X; pretend you're excited about the university's diversity agenda; and pretend you're buying everything they're selling. </p><p>Feel free to chime in with all the ones I missed. </p><p></p><p><br/>

	</p><p>Postdoc is a troll, right? He’s making big claims about lying, then minimizing it/giving it a veneer of plausibility by describing things that are either bullshit, meaningless for search committees, so vague that they encompass normal behavior, or apply to a vanishingly small number of cases. </p><p>In order: <br/>
1.	Bullshit, meaningless, and vanishingly small number. “most universities I’ve been at” lost or failed to keep official files. Public institutions have records laws here. Moreover, there are databases of the scores, and can easily provide just a summary. And “most” is, what?, 2 of 3? 3 of 5? Just how many universities have you taught at?  Finally, self-reporting teaching eval scores are meaningless to search committees, especially if unsupported by other evidence. I’ll also say that, like 2 below, this is a lie about this would sink a candidate. So, it’s low-reward, high-risk.</p><p>2.	Bullshit and meaningless. Not many search committees pay attention to “co-taught” classes. And “so long as the higher ups are in on it” is interesting. Are you saying that some letter writer will say that you co-taught a course? An outright lie?  Bullshit.</p><p>Here I’ll note that IF this happens (again, I think postdoc is trolling), and it got found out in some way (e.g., I encounter the co-teacher somewhere and ask about it, or know her and write about it) and it comes out that it’s a lie, the candidate is *done*. If they have an offer, it’s pulled. If they have accepted the offer, we’re going fraud-in-the-inducement and claiming it’s void. If they’re on staff, probationary contract is where it ends. In other words, it’s a lie that is at once meaningless (co-teaching a course is almost never a difference-maker) and the kind of thing that will run you out of the profession. </p><p>3.	Exaggerate your importance. So vague it encompasses normal behavior. If you’re one coauthor of four, but did less than ¼ the work, it fits this category. But it’s normal behavior, and the kind of thing people will look at it with appropriate nuance, and it won’t be a difference maker. </p><p>4.	Exaggerate connections. Bullshit. How do “connections” come up in an application, other than via coauthorship, references, or supervisor relationships? How are you parlaying some emails into something that looks like a real connection so that it reflects positively on you? Are you listing someone as a reference after a few emails, not providing a letter from that person, and expecting we won’t contact them? </p><p>5.	Exaggerate your abilities, and YET “seem confident and knowledgeable.” This is either vanishingly small number of cases or meaningless. I got questioned about a genuine AOS (I’d published in it! I’d taught it successfully!) in an interview and embarrassed myself answering. Like, whole dinner table was uncomfortable, and search chair had to make a joke to get conversation back on track. In other words, it’s hard enough to seem confident and knowledgeable *even when you are an expert*. Good luck seeming confident and knowledgeable about something you know little about.  If it’s something that is so far from the job (e.g., not part of philosophy) that people don’t know enough to ask questions, then it’s probably meaningless.</p><p>6.	“pretend they are equivalent to peer review.” Yeah, we check. And we can tell most of the papers that are due to connections—by venue, by editor, by topic. So, bullshit. </p><p>Also, it's high risk for all the reasons Marcus and others suggest in this post and others. If you do this and we check, you're done. </p><p>7.	Omit facts. Are you listing yourself as a PI when you’re not? If so, see number 2—this would tank a candidate at any stage of their career. Are you just “on” it? Then it’s meaningless, no one cares. </p><p>8.	Normal behavior, and not at all equivalent to the bad stuff listed above, so tossed in here to lend an air of plausibility. Also hard to fake. And also not particularly convincing without an explanation. You can feign enthusiasm for a place, but absent a reason (family nearby, have a passion you can pursue nearby) it's meaningless.</p><p>So, postdoc’s a troll, and one who admits to committing fraud. [I expect he’ll write back with more hangdog nonsense, “oh I’m just reporting, it YOU who’s naïve.” Pound sand.]  But, for those of you applying for jobs or grants, if you think he’s sincere, ignore his poison-the-well nonsense. Marcus refers to someone out of the profession for this kind of thing. There are others. Untrustworthy colleagues are a disaster for departments. </p><p>Oh, lastly, “unless you have plausible deniability.” Good luck with that. Search committees love hearing denials of fraud that rise to the level of "plausible." Moves candidates right on up the fly-out list. <br/>

	</p><p>My understanding is that it is perfectly fine to explicitly list things 'under contract' under publications, both for books and for articles/chapters. </p><p>My sense is that this is fine (whereas listing articles under review or under R&amp;R is not fine) because a contract is a presumptive commitment by a publisher to *actually* publish the work. In this regard, it is roughly akin to a conditional acceptance, which I understand to be fine to explicitly list under publications for analogous reasons. </p><p>Everyone knows that book contracts can fall through, just like conditional acceptances can fall through with journals (if, for example, the editor rejects the final manuscript). The important thing is simply to list explicitly that the book is under contract (not "forthcoming", unless the final version has been accepted). That way, if the contract somehow falls through and anyone asks about it, you can always provide the contract to show that what you listed on your CV was honest.</p><p>But perhaps I am wrong about this. I'd be curious to see if anyone has a different take.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Nothing should be listed as a publication unless it is definitively going to be published. A book, book chapter, or article under contract is "Work in Progress." So is an article that has been conditionally accepted. I feel fairly confident that this judgment is pretty widely shared, though I could be wrong about that.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Misc. R1 prof: Interesting, I guess that makes sense—and it just occurred to me that I do something slightly different on my own CV that I’d be curious to get your take on. My CV just lists “Books” and then lists my 2016 book and then my second book as “under contract.” Similarly, I have a heading for “Articles in Edited Volumes” that lists articles already published as well as those under contract. The only heading that I have that explicitly says *publications* is my category for peer-reviewed journal publications.</p><p>In your view, is this approach fine?

	</p><p>I agree with Misc. R1 prof. (except maybe about conditional acceptances). Let me add that the advice I was given, which seems right to me and which aligns with what I tell my grad students, is that if something is both basically done (i.e. you have a very polished version of it), is guaranteed to be published (i.e. it was either accepted at a peer-reviewed journal, or was invited and the editor has made clear that they will be publishing it), then it can go under publications. </p><p>I think one source of confusion here is about invited publications--they can still be peer reviewed, they can still be rejected by the editor who invited you, etc.--but I don't know if grad students and other people who are quite junior on the market realize that. </p><p>In general, I think the "cannot list it under publications unless you have actually done the work" rule is a good one. So if you have a book contract, but not a complete, polished, accepted (or conditionally accepted) version of the book, that should not be listed as a publication but rather 'work in progress'. Likewise for an article you were commissioned to write. </p><p>The only thing I'm more on the fence about is conditional acceptances at journals. I think of conditional acceptances as acceptances with some very minor required changes. I do know of one case in which someone's conditionally accepted paper was then rejected, but the fact is that everyone who heard of this case thought that the journal behaved very, very badly. This makes me think that a conditional acceptance is thought of by most people as a guaranteed publication, and in such a case someone does have a very polished version of the paper in hand. </p><p>I think that one thing that is de-emphasized way too much in discussions about the market is the difference between how much work you've basically completed (and how good that work is) and how much work you've published. At least in my dept, no one is going to care about your book contract or your commissioned article that you have not yet written. This is because we basically don't think that, at least early on in the process of trying to publish, what journal something is published in or whether it is published is a good guide to how good the work is. </p><p>To list commissioned but not complete work under 'publications' seems extremely deceptive to me. Departments like mine want to know what your plan is to get tenure. There's a world of difference between 'someone asked me to write a paper for this volume' and 'this project is finished and I can now spend my time on other things'. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

But I'm still counting on the day that this type of email is sent to me personally, and I suspect the odds are high it will happen. Then I will think of the best way to publicize the discussion. Until then my options are much more limited, as I value my friends more than my childish need to be proven right. </p><p>Anyway- I'm too tired to deal with it as things are. Maybe I will be in the mood another day. The world isn't the way I want it be. Oh well.

What I can't seem to get over, (and I should, I really should, it is immature of me not to) is that the philosophy profession also consists of two groups who both frustrate me to no end, (1) those who know the profession is not aimed at truth and virtue, but like to pretend it is anyway, and (2) those who are still naive enough to believe that philosophy, to a degree much greater than other professions, is aimed at truth and virtue. </p><p>FWIW, the email is real.

	</p><p>I like the discussion about books and articles under contract because I think it illustrates just how hard it can be to do the right thing on the job market. While there is vast disagreement about this issue (just go look at CVs of random established and assistant professors - I would bet most have contracted books either under "books" or "publications.") I was told by my job market mentor (not through the cocoon program), in strong terms, that it looked bad to have a "works in progress" section on my CV.  But even though there is disagreement, people feel very strongly and confidently about their opinion, and seem to hold it against a candidate if they find out the CV wasn't written in the way they think is obviously correct.</p><p>I just think it is odd to have a separate policy for contracted work depending on whether you have a copy of the work on your computer.  So if someone put that on a CV, you would have to email them and ask if they have a completed copy to know whether you considered that an honest use of the word "publication"? It just seems either you take the position that something has to be accepted, or that under contract is good enough (and being invited to do a chapter isn't yet a contract, or at least not d</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I tend to agree that lies are either too big of a risk, (there is a good chance of detecting them) or that they will offer very little reward. I also agree that most of the time a candidate's character and just general pleasantness to be around are taken into account. Actually, I suspect this is done to a greater degree than is fair, and that the large number of socially awkward people that used to be very common in the profession are going to become a small minority, as the competition is so stiff search committees have a choice between very talented and socially *competent* philosophers, and very talented and socially *incompetent* philosophers. That said, the bigger of a deal one is, at least at research universities, the less people will care about character and pleasantness. If you are a hot shot from a top program, most R1's will put aside the fact that you are an ass. Or, as we have learned with Berkeley, that you physically /sexually assault female undergraduates. While tolerance for sexual harassment, and even more, assault, has thankfully gone down, there is still plenty of problematic things search committees will overlook if you bring prestige to a research university (of course not all R1s, not all the time, but I am just saying this is common.) </p><p>In addition, none of this speaks to other morally problematic aspects of hiring that don't have much to do with out right lies. If you got a paper in [Highly-Ranked Journal Name Redacted], you have a paper in [Journal Redacted], whether or it was actually blind reviewed. I know some people won't believe this story. And as it was happening yesterday , I had this overwhelming wish I had some type of recorder and that I could show it to the cocoon readers. But I didn't. And I wouldn't publicly rat out a friend, anyway. So those who won't believe me, won't believe me. But for others who find me a perhaps somewhat believable poster, this is what happened: I was having lunch with a friend who is a R1 professor. We talked about publishing, the best kind of system, etc. It came up that my friend recently got a request to review a paper for [Journal Redacted]. My friend wrote to the editor and said, "I know who wrote this paper. I have already seen it presented at a workshop." The editor wrote back, "It doesn't matter." (I am not sure if that is a direct quote.) In any case, my friend reviewed the paper, and a RandR was recommended. My friend said that it was an RandR instead of an acceptance because they were worried about being too positively biased toward the paper. Eh. This is how it goes. </p><p>Digression aside, at my university when you go up for tenure, there is a committee that *very closely* reviews your CV. It is actually somewhat common to find "mistakes" (things that are not true) listed on the CV. Most of the time what happens is there isn't really enough evidence to assume the person was lying, so nothing much happens other than the correction is made and maybe some people think of you differently. But notice in this case you don't get any benefit, and probably some harm,. This even happens with publications, by the way. But that is usually in the sciences, where people have very long lists of publications (can be hundreds), and the untruths have to do with the order of the authoring.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Amanda<br/>
Can you please clarify what the morally questionable or disturbing part of your story is?  Is it that the editor let your friend referee even though he knew who the author was?  Or is it that your friend gave a R&amp;R assessment, for fear of being biased?  I truly want to understand the situation.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Trying to understand: I can’t speak for Amanda, but I can speak for myself. If a journal states that their editorial policy is that the journal practices anonymized review but then the editor tells a referee who knows the author’s identity to go right ahead and review it, then the editor has violated the journal’s own policy, as well as a peer-review practice (anonymized review) the very purpose of which is to prevent people from unfairly helping their friends or hurting those they may have biases against. The point of anonymized review is at least partly ethical in nature, and in permitting violations of it a journal arguably commits two ethical violations: (1) dishonesty about its practices (saying it practices anonymized review when it doesn’t really), and (2) undermining a practice the very purpose of which is to prevent unethical behavior (bias for and against people unfairly impacting the publishing process).</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Trying to understand: I don't think my friend did anything wrong, or at least it was much less wrong than what the editor and the journal did.  Here is what is morally disturbing though, summarized as what as I see is the big picture problem.</p><p>Journals claim to take blind review very seriously. They write that on their webpage and publicize it is the journal's strict policy. And then in practice, they act completely contrary to those claims. That is false advertisement and it is deceptive. It is also deceptive in a way that has serious and negative consequences for the discipline. Blind review was designed because their is overwhelming evidence that humans cannot fairly assess the work of someone when they know the author, especially when the author is someone they know well, and even more so, a friend. Hence, blind review was designed to allow the impartial assessment of philosophical quality. The entire point (or a huge point) of journals is that  they are a screening system to separate quality work from work that is not of the same quality. When something is published in a top journal, the thought is it has gone through a screening process that makes it especially likely that it will be of high quality. But if there is no blind review, and especially if papers are frequently reviewed by the author's friends, then this screening process is broken. The review system is not doing what is (1) designed to do, and (2) what the journals claim that it does. Even more, this system gives even more advantages to those who are already advantaged. Those in the prestige circles of philosophy will have a meaningful advantage in getting published, as it is more likely their paper will be reviewed by a friend who already views their work highly. </p><p>Now, it might be the case that there is no reasonable way to have blind review anymore. I will push aside whether this is actually the case but suppose that it is the case. Well, if so, journals should stop claiming to be blind review. They should simply claim to be peer review. Or at the very least, it should be made clear that "we will attempt to find a reviewer who does not know the author, but this is not always possible." It is wrong to have a system that claims to be blind review when it isn't, especially when there is so much extra weight given to journal articles in virtue of the fact they are blind reviewed. For instance, we just talked about anthology articles. These are typically given less weight than journal articles because the idea is that journal articles are blind reviewed. Grad students with a great publication record (or anyone with this record, really) are considered, in some sense, to have demonstrated some type of impressive skill because they managed to get articles past blind review. But if at least some of the people with great publishing records have many of their papers reviewed by friends and associates, this is a very misleading social norm. It allows people who published via connections *to claim* that they published via talent. So if we cannot have blind review because it is impractical, we should stop calling it this. </p><p>What I find shocking is the simultaneous existence of persons in the profession who,</p><p>1. Know that this happens all the time but think that it is no big deal (but are oddly opposed to just slightly modifying the system so that we call it "peer review" instead of "blind peer review."</p><p>2. People who, against much evidence, insist that this kind of situation is a rarity, and that the vast majority of the time, people with great publishing records had most of their papers blindly and impartially reviewed (in my experience, these people tend to be those who have "worked their way up"  and maybe landed an R1 job when their PhD wasn't prestigious. The cynic in me thinks that they don't want to lose the claim that their talent allowed them to overcome the odds *and* that they are part of a research circle that *really* is more talented than those out of the circle. Well, maybe these people did work their way up, some papers, many papers, are indeed blind reviewed. But the more connected one is, the less likely this is to be true.)</p><p>I tend to think my friend did little wrong because they know that the journal does not follow blind review, so if they refused to review the paper, it could just go to another person who might be more biased than my friend. But one might make the argument every person must play their role, no matter how small, in trying to make the system work. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Marcus, maybe I'm more idiosyncratic than I thought, but that seems pretty obviously wrong to me. I haven't listed any of my books under "Books" until they were legitimately in press: that is, they had been accepted and only awaiting copyediting and such. Until then they were under "Work in Progress." (And it seems absolutely insane to me to object to a Work in Progress section.)</p><p>As for conditionally accepted articles, if one hasn't met the conditions yet, they haven't been accepted yet. So they're not publications yet.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Miscellaneous R1 Professor: Your position is fine. You have reasons for it that seem reasonable. But perhaps it would help to know that many don't see it as clear as you do. The vast majority of people i've talked to (and I guess this could be not representative, but that would seem odd) support conditional acceptances as something to put as a publication. (I've never had a conditional acceptance, so I have no stake here.) The book thing is not as universal, but I would still say confidently that a decent chunk of people think a signed book contract is okay to put under publications, as long as it is made clear what the state of the publishing process actually is. </p><p>I think the reasoning from people on both of these things goes like this: what matters (in this world where the publishing process is ungodly slow, and where it is common for books and articles to be read, distributed, and discussed before they are actually published.) is the *odds* that something will be published. Once something is conditionally accepted, the odds are probably like 98% that it will be published, if not higher. While signed book contracts are probably not as high, my guess is that they are pretty high - but maybe I'm wrong about that. </p><p>Unless I am missing something, it seems you are using a similar reasoning process. You are okay putting it down as a publication when it is written and all that needs to happen is copy-editing. But why is that the standard, as opposed to when it actually comes out? Something could always happen, even though the odds are low, that results in it not actually being published. Moreover, if it is not published, if we want to get technical, then it is not "a publication yet." </p><p>The objection I got to the works in progress section was like this: "You already have enough publications. Putting down a works in progress section is something someone does when they are desperate and don't have enough publications. Works in progress don't mean anything  because you can just completely make them up so there is no sense in taking in anything in that section seriously." FWIW, I ignored the advice and included the section anyway, and seemed to do well on the market. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>My thoughts on this may have been shaped too much by what seems like a zillion years on T&amp;P committees, where there's a bright-line rule: only what is definitively in press "counts." It's not about odds, though; it's about whether the work is fully submitted and there's a definite commitment on the part of the press/journal/whatever to publish it. Sure, it's probably no more likely that my conditionally accepted article won't be accepted than it is that my book currently in second-pass proofs won't see the light of day. But the latter has cleared all hurdles in a way that the former has not.</p><p>Having acknowledged now -- twice -- that my views on this may well be out of the mainstream, I won't belabor that. If anything, this all simply illustrates a point made above: you just can't win with this stuff. If you put a book under contract under "Books," I'm going to think you're padding (and ignorant of professional norms). If you put it under "Work in Progress," someone else is going to think you're padding (and ignorant of professional norms). It doesn't matter as much for me, because people kind of expect senior-ish people to do weird things on their CVs. But junior people are expected to do things *the right way* -- only there's nothing like consensus on what the right way is.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Thanks MR1P and Amand--seriously, very helpful. </p><p>Let's rephrase: what's the most risk-averse way to put a book that's *under contract*--that is, a signed contract with agreement to publish so long as it meets basic requirements of length, timing, and looks like a scholarly book--on a junior scholar's CV?  Would a heading of "Under Contract" just below "Articles" look like padding to anyone? Maybe include something like "proposal and chapters available upon request" in parentheses?</p><p>I'm advising someone on this right now...so suggestions appreciated!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Philosadjacent - I think this is pretty hard to tell. And the recent conversation here makes it even harder than I realized. I suspect any advice on this is going to be a "best guess." But if I was going on the market again, I would personally now do the following in having the wide-ranging heading and then sub-headings:</p><p>PUBLISHED, FORTHCOMING, AND CONTRACTED RESEARCH (I would clearly label things, so that it was obvious wha was what - if something was already published I think just putting regular citation info should be clear.)</p><p>Books</p><p>Articles</p><p>Reviews</p><p>Popular Writing</p><p><br/>
I would then have a separate main heading</p><p>WORKS IN PROGRESS</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>WAY earlier in this thread, someone recommended against putting things like "Awards" ahead of one's publications on a CV.  I actually think there are cases in which that can make sense.  Our discipline is becoming more like other disciplines in that one's ability to bring in grants and win prizes can make one more attractive to employers.  So if you've got some of those to show off, it can make sense to list them above your publications.  But I'd recommend this mainly for more senior people, with the necessary condition that you actually have impressive things to list in your Awards/Grants section.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I am just about to start graduate school (MA/PhD) and I have a related CV question. I was notified that one of my articles was accepted by an undergraduate journal the week I graduated with my BA. Since this is a publication, should I continue to list it on my CV, as long as it is clear that it is in an undergraduate journal? Should I remove the publication once I am a few years into graduate school? I am proud of the work I did. It reflects one of my major research interests and a chunk of my undergraduate thesis, so I want to show it off a bit, but not if it undermines my CV. Thanks.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='i'>Job-Market Boot Camp, Part 4: Letters of Recommendation</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">I'd like to continue the Cocoon's <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/job-market-boot-camp/" target="_self">Job Market Boot Camp</a> by discussing recommendation letters. Although the role that recommendation letters should play in hiring is debatable--as letters may be more indicative of letter-writers biases, etc., than good reflections of candidates' abilities--I have many reasons to believe that having good letters is really important. First, after my PhD, it was one of the things that just about everybody impressed upon me. I was told, basically by everyone, "you <em>have</em> to get letters from well-respected people outside of your department." Second, although it is very difficult to tease out causal influences, there was a distinct trend in my own case. The more outside letters I had, the more interviews I seemed to get.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But I am already getting ahead of myself. There are two very different types of situations: (1) the ABD student who has not yet graduated, and (2) the person with the PhD who has been out on the market a while. Let's discuss each situation in turn.<em><br/></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>1. Letters of recommendation and the ABD student</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">As I understand it, it is <em>okay</em> to only have letters from your PhD program if you have not yet graduated, as it is admittedly hard to network while in grad school. That being said, the students <em>I</em> knew in grad school who had letters from people outside the department seemed to fare fantastically well--far better than those who only had letters from within. So, I would definitely advise grad students to try to network early and often, and try to obtain at least one outside letter before hitting the market. I'll say more about how to do this in section 3 below.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One other good thing to do--or so I've heard (more on this shortly)--is to <em>have your department placement-director read and evaluate your letters</em>. I have to be honest. I never did this. However, I've <span style="text-decoration: underline;">heard</span> of cases where a candidate had a lukewarm letter from someone, and this (apparently) is not good. In the US, at least, it is supposed expected that all of your letters will be stellar, and one lukewarm letter may sink your candidacy. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Third, unless you have no teaching experience at all, you should always have at least one teaching letter written by someone who has actually observed you teach. How many teaching letters do you need? I never procured more than one, and it never seemed to hurt me with teaching oriented schools. As long as the teaching letter is good and by someone who has actually seen you teach, that seems (from my experience) to be good enough.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anything I missed?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>2. Letters of recommendation after the PhD</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Once you've completed your PhD, there seem to be two important things to stay on top of: (1) ensuring that your letters are updated every year or two, and (2) obtaining more letters from respected people in the profession. Let me begin with the first of these.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I've been told that it is important to keep your letters up to date, and this pretty much stands to reason. If you've been out on the market for a few years and have accomplished stuff--published some good pieces of work--it would presumably be to your advantage for your letter writers to talk up these accomplishments and your overall development as a philosopher. How do you go about it? Simple: just send an email to your letter writers seeing how things are going with them, and asking if they would mind updating your letter. In my experience, they will usually do so happily, asking for an updated CV and a few pieces of recent work. I might also add that it probably helps if you stay in touch with them independently, checking in with them a few times a year to say hello, etc. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">It's also important to keep your teaching letter(s) up to date. If you've been out on the market for a few years, in a VAP position, post-doc, whatever, have someone in a senior position at your current institution watch you teach and write a letter. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I've only had one person respond negatively to a letter-update request, and because my experience here contradicts some of the received advice I gave above (on lukewarm letters), I figured it might be helpful to share my experience. After a couple of years out on the market, when I asked one of my recommenders if they would be willing to update their letter, the response I received was basically, "I don't know how much my letter would help you at this point"--the obvious implication being that the letter would be lukewarm at best (note: I didn't blame this person at all. My dissertation wasn't spectacular by any means, I hadn't published much at that point, and I don't think I ever much impressed them). Anyway, I thanked them for their honesty and proceeded that year without their letter...and got like no interviews. The next year, I asked the same person if I could use their own (lukewarm?) letter, they said yes, and I got a lot more interviews. So, who knows, maybe a lukewarm letter isn't a job-market death sentence, after all.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, then, we come to the big question: <em>how do you go about getting outside letters</em>?</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>3. Networking and outside letters</strong></p><p style="text-align: justify;">I'll be honest about something. For most of my life, I looked at "networking" as sort of distasteful. It always seemed to me like sucking up or brown-nosing, or whatever. I now believe that this is the wrong attitude to have. Although I am still no fan of being a sycophant, crude "social-climber", or whatever (and I recognize that not everyone finds those things so distasteful), I think it is entirely possible to network effectively and get letters without such motives. Early on after my PhD, I didn't network very effectively. Then I just started talking to people at conferences, without any real motive except to get over my shyness and try to be more open! I also met people in other ways. For instance, I applied and was accepted t0 a NEH summer institute in political philosophy, and simply had a great time. The organizers were really great guys, and so at the end of the seminar I simply asked them if they'd be willing to write a letter. They did!</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A couple of my other letters came about in similarly unsought, serendipitous ways. When I published <a href="http://philpapers.org/rec/ARVANT-2" target="_self">my paper on free will</a>, the journal gave me the option of giving ten "colleagues" free access to the publication. Since I hardly knew anyone in the discipline at that point (seriously!), I put in the email of someone who had been a previous professor of mine long ago, whose work I always admired, and whose work actually inspired my paper a bit. I thought, "Hmm...I wonder what they would think of this piece?" Lo and beyond, a couple months later, I received an email from them saying they liked the article. It just so happens then that I had written a response paper to one of their other articles, so I asked if they would read it. They gave me some great feedback, was really encouraging, we exchanged some other stuff, and I've considered them a friend ever since. At some point later on, I asked if they would write a letter for the job-market, and they said yes! Another one of my letters came about in a similar war.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, I guess that's what I would say about getting outside letters. Some people are cool with being "networkers", and such. I used to keep to myself because I <em>didn't</em> feel cool with that (it always felt sort of icky to me!). Fortunately, though, as I've said above, I think there are non-icky ways to go about it. You don't have to go "looking for letters" at all. Just try to make friends, engage with other people's work and have conversations with them, etc., and letters of recommendation might just be an unexpected (and unsought!) positive result. After you know someone a bit, and have a good relationship with them, if it seems appropriate to ask for a letter, ask away. The worst they can do is say no, and in my experience, this is pretty uncommon. More common, in my experience, are <em>qualified yes</em> answers--with the person I asked saying, "Well, I don't really work in your AOS, but I could write you a letter in terms of what <em>I</em> think of your work." For what it's worth, anytime anyone offered me a qualified yes of this sort, I jumped at the opportunity. It seemed to work well, at least in term of job-market results.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, these are my thoughts. Have I missed anything? Gotten anything wrong?

	</p><p>Thanks for all this, Marcus. It's very helpful stuff. I thought I'd add a comment from the perspective of a UK-based job hunter. We don't have placement people in the UK and so have no way, as far as I'm aware though I'd love to be proven wrong, to evaluate our letters of reference. As a matter of fact I'm concerned about my letters at the moment, as I have no way of telling what they say and stupidly forgot to ask for a "strong" letter when I asked for them two or three months ago. It looks a bit rude or awkward to approach my referees now to ask!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Filippo: Interesting. I would be surprised if someone would write you a lukewarm letter without letting you know. In my experience asking people for letters, people will typically let you know if they have any concerns about the quality or relevance of the letter they will write on your behalf.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>What do people think about letters from people who are technically not philosophers but have some serious philosophical interests? I could get very strong letters from both a political theorist I know and an economist whose interests are mostly in political philosophy. Would that be helpful or not? I thought it might be since one of my areas is political, but given the knee jerk reaction philosophy professors often have to other disciplines I wasn't sure.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

I think the important thing is for the letter writer to be someone whose name will be recognized.  If the person has some sort regional reputation only, then their letter will count for nothing (or less).  Similarly, if the letter writer is unknown to other philosophers (those reading the letter) because they are not themselves a philosopher, then it will count for nothing.  If a file has letters in it that count for nothing, it tends to lead committees to think that the applicant has poor judgment.  After all, you get to choose your letter writers.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Thanks so much for this post, Marcus (and for the whole job market boot camp series, which I have personally found to be incredibly useful.)</p><p>Quick question, either for Marcus or for anyone else who may be able to answer: most job ads ask for 3 letters or more. Say you have 2 strong general letters and a strong teaching letter. Could you just use the 2 general letters and the teaching letter? Or will it look weird to not have 3 general letters? Let's suppose the ad doesn't specify -- just asks for 3 letters.</p><p>thanks in advance!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

For teaching jobs, send 2 general letters and the one teaching letter.</p><p>Simple as that! Research schools care most about research, and teaching schools care about both. Your teaching portfolio will give research schools a sufficient idea of whether you're a competent teacher, and they can always contact your teaching reference if you include it on your CV (as you should).</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Thanks, Marcus. </p><p>quick follow-up/clarification: say you've had your letters vetted and have been told your third general letter is somewhat weak -- not terrible, just not the strongest. should you still send all 3 letters to research schools?

	</p><p>Thank you, this is super good. I would like to add a few words pertaining to the UK market. Others can weigh in whether it generalizes to Europe as a whole. The Covering letter in your application for a UK job is more important than in USA, I have come to learn. Because there are fewer jobs to go around and the departments differ substantially in their focus, UK job candidates usually explain in the letter how they see themselves fitting into the department's teaching and research.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Thank you, Helen.<br/>
A few minot points:<br/>
—You need an habilitation also in France and, since only a few years, Italy. <br/>
—This means that candidates  applying for a professorship in, say, Germany, must either have completed their habilitation or have an equivalent achievement (typically, in our field, a second book out). Candidates coming from a country in which the habilitation exists are rather expected to have completed it if they apply for a professorship. <br/>
—I had a similar reaction when I read Marcus' remark about not having ever received a research grant. In Europe as I know it it would be beyond imagination to secure a TT position if one has not been able to show that his or her research is top-class by competing for a research grant and having the value of one's research projects independently assessed.<br/>
—I am surely biased, but I tend to like the research-grant system, since it allows also to outsiders to receive grants, if only they have great research ideas and can develop them convincingly in a research project. In this sense, they can learn to be ambitious and to lead a research group, independently of senior professors.</p><p>Just as an aside, as I know it was not at all your main topic: Just from an epistemological point of view, I do not think the article (<a href="http://crookedtimber.org/2010/03/23/why-does-italian-academia-suck/)" rel="nofollow">http://crookedtimber.org/2010/03/23/why-does-italian-academia-suck/)</a> linked to about the situation in Italy is a reliable source of information. It is not based on sound data, but on anonymous sources or on specific personal cases and on a vague appeal to the authority of its author (see, for instance, the author's comments No. 7 and No. 20). We can perhaps do better than that. (Caveat lector: I was born in Italy and studied there for a while, although I have then been working chiefly in other parts of the world.)</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Thank you for your response Elisa! </p><p>I do think grants have an advantage, as you have the potential for outsiders to break into a system that otherwise would probably more of an old boys' network. As you say, it is, or could be conducive to a more meritocratic system. For instance, in The Netherlands, one can negotiate a permanent contract if one can get a large grant - I am happy though that it's not yet the case that only large grant holders can get jobs, although it's increasingly the case that only large grant holders can flourish in a research context. </p><p>But I worry that grants create an illusion of meritocracy (and I say this as someone who has one over 600,000 euros in grant funding, so it's not sour grapes!).</p><p>I dislike the culture of very large grants (e.g., the ERC starting grant is 1.5 million euros). This creates enormous incentives to waste lots of time and energy in unsuccessful grant applications, and creates very few winners who moreover have a specific profile (obvious outreach potential, for instance, previous grants). Smaller grants with more grant holders would be better - there's also research indicating that small grants have a higher relative return on investment than larger ones.</p><p>About Italy, I probably shouldn't have linked to that piece, which is a visceral appraisal of the situation. Initially, I thought of linking to this piece: <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021160" rel="nofollow">http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0021160</a><br/>

	</p><p>Just a few corrections and additions about Germany: 1. You do not need a Habilitation to apply for a permanent full professorship (and to get one). However, you need to demonstrate that your academic accomplishments are equivalent to a Habilitation. That does not need to be a book. Sufficiently many papers in good journals typically suffice. It is fair to say though that some older professors view people without books with suspicion. <br/>
2. Germany has a central national funding agency, the DFG, that distributes a lot of money (grants, projects, scholarships etc.). Some of the programmes are designed to give younger people the opportunity to develop an independent research program and build up an independent research group (Emmy Noether Programm for example). Those grants are very competitive, but they can fund up to 5 years, and the people who had them in the past were very succesful on the job market (in Germany and abroad afterwards). The DFG is definitely less old-fashioned than the Universities themselves. <br/>
3. It is true that in German younger scholars are significantly more dependent on their senior colleagues than in most other places. However, there are many more ways to apply for your own Post-Doc position yourself, rather than to get hired (DFG, Thyssen Foundation, Humboldt etc.). And in this case you can find an environment where with respect to your research you will be your own boss. Not in other respects though... <br/>
4. You typically do not need to know German to apply for a Post-Doc in Germany, and in many places people are happy to have somebody around who can teach in English well (there are many visiting students from abroad who want to take Philosophy classes). But you will not be part of the community at your University for real, until you can have conversations in German, Hardly any committee will discuss anything in German just because you are there!<br/>
5. Germsany has a public academic system. The wages are determined according to specific scales. Typically, your wage will be better than in the UK, and not worse than Assistant Professorships in the US, but it won't go up very much until you become a Full Professor. And even then, wou won't get rich as a philosopher in Germany! The benefits and the social system are great. Very family-friendly!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>@Helen, thanks for the answer. I had lunch today with a colleague who is the principal investigator in an ERC and we have in fact been debating the pros and cons of such big grants (pros: to be able to coordinate a team and see an ambitious project come true, to be able to speak face-to-face with important professors, to set the agenda in a given field through workshops, articles, and the like; cons (as you say): a load of administrative work). It would be interesting to discuss the topic in a separate post, perhaps.</p><p>As for the article you linked in the comment, I think it is much better grounded than the one linked to in the post, but still, it fails to prove the point that the Italian academy is closed to outsiders. In fact, the only thing it *might* prove is that there are some academics whose parents or close relatives were academics as well. But is this a phenomenon typical of Italy alone? Of Academia alone? What about lawyers, notaries, pharmacists… (who are, at least in Italy, also not infrequently born in families of other lawyers, notaries, pharmacists…)? Once again, my reservations are merely about the epistemological aspect of how one comes to a certain conclusion.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hey, I realize this post is older, but, in case anyone's still checking this, a couple questions for Helen or anyone who is familiar with the European market.</p><p>First, do European applications generally require and/or encourage a research statement upfront? In the U.S., applicants frequently include both a dissertation summary (if they're ABD or newly minted Ph.D.s) and a brief description of one or two projects they plan to undertake in the future (the "research statement"). Is this similar to what is required for Europe? </p><p>Second, in the U.K., where job talks are usually quite short, e.g., 30 minutes, is it expected that one talks on a topic different than what was discussed in one's writing sample? Or is itacceptable to present on one's writing sample? Relatedly, do job talks generally require circulation of a draft in advance? </p><p>Thanks so much in advance for any feedback!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hi anon - in response to your queries and answering to the best of my knowledge (most experience with UK, Belgium, Netherlands, not with other countries):</p><p>- For a postdoc or a tenure-track equivalent position, you generally do need a research statement. This can be quite extensive. For jobs that were advertised in Leuven while I was there, you could get a TT job with a low teaching load (2-3 courses per year I think), and you needed a 5000 word research statement. For Oxford postdocs I've seen advertised, one needed a 500 to 1000 word statement on how one would do the project. But for ordinary permanent posts with higher teaching loads (like mine) no research statement is required. </p><p>- I think it looks stronger if the topic is different in writing sample and job talk. For instance, during the interview, it is not uncommon to ask questions about the writing sample, which would then overlap with the Q&amp;A from the job talk. Having two different things make you look like having a more active research profile, especially if you are ABD or other early career status and few papers out in published venues. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hi Helen, </p><p>If you're still checking this -- I have a question about rank in Europe. Looking at European philosopher's CV's, I've noticed that many proceed straight from post-doc status to associate professor status. Is this common? Does this mean North American candidates with a few years' post-doc experience might try for positions advertised as associate professorships in Europe?</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hi anon - Yes, depending on where it is. Most European systems do not have a tenure-track system, so you go straight from a postdoc (or, increasingly, a string of postdocs) on a tenured position. In the UK, these entry-level positions are lecturer positions, in the Netherlands, it's universitair docent. But in some places the tenured position is called "associate professor" to reflect the level of seniority people who occupy the position have (if you've been a postdoc for 7 years, you're hardly junior anymore). In some countries, a habilitation might be required (usually it is stated in the ad). It is uncommon for people to be hired right out of grad school in such a tenured associate professor position but I have seen it happen twice, so it does not hurt to try if you've got a few postdoc years under your belt (and if you have an impressive publication CV - publications matter more in Europe than in the US because of all the metrics and assessments - you can even try when right out of grad school, but you need your PhD in hand). </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='n'>Job-Market Boot Camp, Part 6: should you utilize a job-market consultant?</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Thus far our <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/job-market-boot-camp/" target="_self">Boot Camp</a> has considered some basic job-market related things:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we move onto other job market/dossier materials--cover letters, research and teaching statements, the teaching portfolio, etc.--I would like to briefly step to the side and consider a very different issue: namely, <em><strong>whether to utilize a job-market consultant</strong>.</em> I want to discuss this issue first because--as I will now explain--I learned a great deal about dossier materials from a job-market consultant that I hired, and I know a few other people who had similar experiences.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let me get some important things out of the way. First, I have <span style="text-decoration: underline;">no</span> ties--personal, financial, or otherwise--to any job consultant. Second, I am not here to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">advertise</span> any particular job consultant. If people would like to share their experiences with specific job-consultants in the comments-section, I will allow and encourage it (though not from advertisers spamming the site!). All that being said, let me begin with some background.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In my first couple of years on the market, while still in/just out of grad school (2007-8), I relied mostly on my grad department's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">placement director</span> for advice on dossier materials. After that, for the next several years (2009-2013!), I relied pretty much on myself: on my own information gathering (i.e. looking at other people's dossier materials online), and soliciting help from friends and colleagues. Unfortunately, although I did get a decent share of interviews over that period, none of them translated into permanent job offers. And so, at the outset of this year, I planned to simply update my dossier as I did in past years--revise my cover letters, research and teaching statements, etc., all on my own.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Then, however, something serendipitous happened to me: not one but <span style="text-decoration: underline;">two</span> of my online philosophy friends who had been on the market a few times both reported to me (independently!) that they had (A) hired a job-market consultant the previous season, (B) got a lot of interviews that season, and (C) got tenure-track jobs. No joke--both of them said the very same thing. I have to admit, I was skeptical. But I was also pretty desperate, so I gave it a try. I not only hired someone to help with my cover-letter, research statement, and teaching statement. Additionally, since a good number of my Skype interviews were not translating into fly-outs, I hired the same service for an "online interview intervention." These services were not cheap. But, I have to say, without exaggeration, that it was probably the best money I ever spent. The quality of the help I received was immediately evident to me as I received it, and the results were the same as my friends': I received a lot more interviews--and at better institutions--than in previous years, and ended up with a tenure-track job.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Allow me to share my experience a bit more. I have to admit, I was pretty skeptical at first. I thought I had a good cover letter template, a good research statement, and a good teaching statement. Indeed, I had even "tested" my dossier materials against the materials that some of my friends had developed with a consultant--and again, I thought my materials compared to theirs well. How wrong I was! When I sent my cover letter to the job-market consultant, they <em>tore it apart</em>. They said I had the tone all wrong, level of detail all wrong, and...well, just about everything else all wrong too. Three drafts later, after they approved my letter, I looked at the final result and...it was really good: far better, by my own lights, than any cover letter I had ever composed on my own.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Then came the teaching statement. Again, I thought mine was pretty good. It was about two pages, and I thought it nicely expressed my passion for teaching, teaching style, commitment to students, etc. And the job-market consultant <em>shredded</em> it. Again, they told me, I had it all wrong: wrong tone, wrong length, wrong content, wrong <em>everything</em>. Three drafts later, I had a one page teaching statement that was plainly superior--by my own lights--to any teaching statement I had ever composed before. It was really plain to me: I really did have the teaching statement all wrong before. My instincts about what a teaching statement should look like had been totally off: I was thinking of my teaching statement from the standpoint of an applicant, not realizing that the standpoint of a search-committee member is <em>very</em> different (and indeed, counter-intuitively so). And so it went with the research statement too. Finally, there was the Skype interview intervention. Here again, I was skeptical--and just as pleasantly surprised. Although the intervention was only 50 minutes long, it was incredibly helpful, and led me to entirely reconceptualize how I prepared for interviews.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I'll say more about all of this--more about precisely what I learned--in future posts on cover letters and other dossier materials. But, for now, let me just say this. The consultant I worked with did <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> "write" my materials in any way. Every word, in every draft, was mine. What the consultant did is provide clear, helpful feedback on precisely what I was doing right, and what I was getting wrong. They did, in other words, what we do for <em>our</em> students with their term-papers. <em><br/></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, then, should you hire a job-market consultant? I cannot answer that question for you, and I cannot provide any assurances that others will have the same positive experiences that I did. What I can say is that, from my perspective, it helped <em>me</em> immeasurably, and that I know at least two other people who reported similar experiences.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-6-should-you-hire-a-job-market-consultant/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-6-should-you-hire-a-job-market-consultant/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>Marcus,<br/>
Thank you for sharing this information.  I would really like to know how much such a service costs.  I have a concern about this trend ... you and your two friends constitute a trend, now.  It seems this practice may be making the profession even less open to people from families without money (poor families, as they were once called).  The idea that we need to spend even more just to stand a chance on the market is a terrible sign.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>A concern: I share your concern. Fortunately, I don't think these kinds of services are prohibitively expensive, at least at this point. The consultant I hired charged $250 total for three job market documents: cover-letter, teaching statement, and research statement. The charge covered four drafts of all three documents. Not cheap. I had to put it on a credit card myself. But, for all that, it's nothing like the several thousand dollars it cost candidates to travel to a single APA to interview...</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Thanks for sharing, again, Marcus.  I am a bit relieved that it was only $250.  But how much was the fee for the assistance with the interview?  For 50 minutes I assume it was not cheap.<br/>
I am inclined to think that graduate programs should be doing a little more for people to professionalize them.  That is, the types of services that you are describing are just the sorts of things a graduate program should assist their students with.  When I was in graduate school, in the mid-1990s, my program offered very little in the way of preparation for the market. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I love the fact that you are sharing this information with the wider community - a good jobmarket consultant truly helps to level the playing field, and lessens the disadvantage of those who (like me) didn't have a lot of help from their graduate program. It is not a guarantee to a job, of course, but like you - I found that I got a lot more interviews, one of which panned out in a tenure track job. It was money well spent. <br/>
I took the decision to hire a consultant when I was invited to give a talk at a department I had applied to a couple of months before. I had just received a standard rejection letter from them. Several dept members who were also in the search committee of that job really enjoyed my talk, and wondered why I hadn't applied for their job. When I said that I in fact had applied, they were genuinely surprised. They couldn't remember my application at all! So that gave me evidence that, in spite of why my advisor, my reference letter writers, and I thought, my cover materials sucked. The consultant also pointed this out to me: tone, content, level of detail, all wrong. <br/>
I wonder whether you have any thoughts on *why* our intuitions about what constitute good cover materials are so off-track? </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hi Anonymous: Thanks for your kind words. In fact, I do have some thoughts on why our intuitions are all wrong!</p><p>I think, as candidates, we have difficulty putting ourselves in the shoes of search committee members. We tend to think of our dossier in isolation, not thinking of the fact that search committee members are going to receive several hundred dossiers just like ours! Allow me to explain how I think this misleads us.</p><p>Consider some common cover letter and teaching statement tactics that--or so my consultant said--most candidates pursue (and which I had pursued myself!). Candidates tend to emphasize their passion for teaching, give broad generalizations about their teaching style (viz. "I have students work in small groups"), say how original their research program is, etc. </p><p>The problem is this. If you are on a search committee, you literally get 300-400 dossiers where people are saying the *same* kinds of things: every cover letter expressing joy for teaching, every teaching statement stating generalizations about having students work in small groups, etc. As such, candidates who say these sorts of thing don't stand out at all! Instead, they blur into all the other candidates, and don't pop out as particularly original or compelling.</p><p>In order to stand out from the crowd, you need to move beyond those common strategies--beyond common, banal generalizations that everyone states: you need to provide *precise* details that distinguish you from everyone else in the crowd. All of which takes a *very* different approach to writing dossier materials... </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I used a job market consultant--probably the same one almost everyone now uses. It didn't help much. While it was nice to have someone completely uninvested in my success look over my materials and give feedback, I also experienced a lot of "No! That is simply not done in a CV" or "No! The cover letter cannot be a narrative!" kind of stuff. Then, as I proceeded to get no interviews again this past season, I began to notice people whose CVs committed the "fatal mistake" the consultant noted and whose cover letters presented narratives get tons of interviews. Honestly, I feel like I paid four hundred dollars for a mixed bag of good suggestions/feedback and some suggestions that, because of their overblown nature, probably hurt my chances. Most of us seek out consultants because we have little to no idea what are good and bad decisions. As such, we are also unprepared to know which suggestions made by a consultant we should adopt and which we shouldn't.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

thank you for sharing the other side of the story.  Indeed, as you point out, it can be challenging to know what gets people job interviews and jobs.  Perhaps it was not the consultant who tipped the balance in Marcus' case.  Perhaps it was.  I would need to know more about YOUR file in order to make any sort of judgment about why things were not better this year.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

It's not an ideal situation, but (A) the services are not prohibitively costly (particularly given the costs of other alternatively involved), (B) they are available to everyone, and (C) they provide helpful information which, if used, can improve one's chances on the market. It does not eliminate "brute bad luck" by any means, but compared to the brute bad luck of simply having BAD information, I think the availability of such services significantly levels the playing field, enabling anyone who is willing to pay a significant (but not prohibitively expensive) fee to obtain useful help and information. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I know I'm way late to the party, but, to pick up on Shaun's question--where does one find a job market consultant? Of course I've googled "academic job consultant", but I only find two people when I do that (one of whom is the famous one who receives very mixed reviews). Is there anyone else out there?</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Ash: very good question. I've come across a few, but can't remember precisely who the different ones are. I think I'll run a post tomorrow asking everyone to list/discuss the different consultants out there.</p><p>I will say, I used the famous one you're most likely referring to. I haven't heard about her having mixed reviews. The people I know who used her all got jobs and referred me to her--and I found her help tremendous and ended up getting a job too.

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='('>Job Market Boot Camp, Part 7: Developing coherent research program(s)</h3><p style="text-align: justify;">Before we move on to discussing dossier materials (cover letters, research and teaching statements, teaching portfolios, etc.), I was thinking it might be good for our <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/job-market-boot-camp/" target="_self">Job-Market Boot Camp</a> to spend some time discussing an issue that a <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/a-reminder-and-a-plan.html#comments" target="_self">few commenters suggested</a> when I first proposed this series: namely, <strong>how to develop a coherent research program post-PhD</strong>. </p><p style="text-align: justify;">In a few moments, I will say a few things from my own experience on this topic. However, I would also like to pose two question to readers, and then invite two groups of people to share their thoughts.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here are my two questions for readers:<em><br/></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">I'll be curious to hear how people answer. As I've mentioned a <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2014/05/in-defense-of-dissertations-a-follow-up-to-millikans-dewey-lecture.html" target="_self">couple</a> <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2013/04/whats-going-on-with-dissertations.html" target="_self">times</a> before, I've wondered whether the new "series of papers" alternative hampers people's ability to develop coherent long-term research programs. Personally, I feel like doing a traditional dissertation was absolutely invaluable for me in terms of learning how to really put together a big, coherent program--and I wonder whether a series of related papers can approximate that. Frankly, it's always been hard for me to see how a series of papers <em>could</em> develop that ability, as a series of three (or four) related papers are, by their very nature, <em>very</em> different--both in structure and scope--different than a book/dissertation. But maybe I'm off. I'm curious to hear what people have to say!<em><br/></em></p><p style="text-align: justify;">Next, because I only have limited experience--namely, my own experience--developing coherent research programs, I would like to invite two classes of people in particular to share their thoughts on the research program issue:</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For successful job candidates, did you do anything in particular to develop/present your research program that seemed to really attract attention on the market? For search committee members, was there anything in particular that you were <em>looking</em> for, and alternatively, things that stood out to you as "red flags" about a candidate's research program?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, here are my thoughts. In my experience, the most important thing when it comes to developing a coherent research program is <em>figuring out what kind of philosopher you are and running with it</em>. Broadly speaking, there seem to me to be two types of philosophers: "lumpers" and "splitters". Lumpers are people who develop a Big Idea, and then use that Big Idea to develop lots of Little Ideas. Rawls, I take it, was a paradigmatic lumper (fairness/original position--&gt;lots of little arguments). Splitters, on the other hand, are people who begin with lots of Little Ideas, and then move from those Little Ideas to a Bigger Idea. David Lewis, I take it, was a paradigmatic splitter (Humeanism + possible worlds + counterfactuals, etc. --&gt; Moral Realism). I guess, finally, there are Synthesizers, who sort of work from both ends--from Big Ideas to lots of Little Ideas, and vice versa. Kant, I guess, seems to me a paradigmatic Synthesizer.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, my general feeling is this: <em>figure out who you are,</em> and the "coherent research program" will come naturally. <em>Don't figure out who you are</em>, and you'll have trouble. I initially struggled with this, post-PhD. My dissertation was based on one Big Difficult Idea. Unfortunately, I had trouble publishing that Idea, as well--it was really Difficult for me to get it right. So, while I sent out dissertation stuff to journals, had it get rejected, revised it, etc., I found myself in a quandary. <em>I needed to find other stuff to work on</em>, just in case the dissertation stuff didn't pan out in terms of publications (not an uncommon result, or so I hear). So, what I initially tried to do is Not Be Myself. I read journal articles in Important Journals by Important People, and tried to write some reply pieces (i.e. Small Ideas) that I hoped would result in a new research program. Unfortunately, although I did publish a couple of these, it felt really stultifying and definitely wasn't leading to a new research program. It occurred to me, "Whatever I am, I am <em>not</em> a splitter. I am not going to get a research program out of a bunch of small ideas."</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, what I did next was trust my instincts--the same Lumper process that led to my dissertation Idea. I taught a human rights course, felt like there was a Big False Assumption dominating the literature, wrote up a paper on it...and found a new research program. Over the next few years, I came up with a couple more research programs in similar way.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The general lesson I think I learned? Once you finish your PhD, you'll come up with coherent research programs...<em>as long as you don't try to be someone you're not</em>. Of course, this was only my experience, but it was a striking one. When I first graduated, I felt like I needed to be the kind of philosopher I thought my advisors/grad school professors would have wanted me to be. As soon as I stopped trying to be the kind of philosopher I thought I was "supposed" to be and started trying to be the kind of philosopher I wanted to be, philosophy instantly became a great deal more enjoyable...and research programs emerged. So, if you're having trouble developing a research program, I say: give it a shot.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Here's another thing I found useful: follow <em>all</em> leads. Don't avoid a new research idea because it seems outlandish or outside your wheelhouse. You never know what might be your next research program. Your next big program might turn out to be something you totally don't expect (this happened to me a couple of times).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One final point I would make is that, in my experience, it's <span style="text-decoration: underline;">perfectly fine</span> to have more than one research program (I actively marketed myself as having four research programs in my final year on the market, and it did not seem to work against me in any way). The important things, though, are these: (1) You should have one, or at most two, <em>dominant</em> research programs (the primary foci of your research statement/cover letters), (2) It is very helpful if you can relate the research programs together, (3) Don't BS search committees, saying you have a "research program" where you don't, and (4) You need to have a clear, detailed, plausible story of precisely how you intend to develop the program over the next 5 years or so. You don't have to have to a ton of publications on the research program to make a plausible case to a search committee that you have a legitimate, coherent research project in an area, but--aside from your dissertation topic--you <em>do</em> need to have some real proof that the program is well-developed (i.e. a few publications, book manuscript, etc.).</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, these are just some of my thoughts. What are yours?</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='dotted'><h3 id='%s'>Comments</h3><p><a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-7-developing-coherent-research-programs/comments/atom.xml"><img alt="Feed" height="10" src="https://static.typepad.com/.shared/images/feed.png" width="10"/></a> You can follow this conversation by subscribing to the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-7-developing-coherent-research-programs/comments/atom.xml">comment feed</a> for this post.</p><p>Hi Marcus, thanks for these interesting reflections on self-knowledge as the key element! <br/>
As for me, I wrote a book-like dissertation and would heartly recommend it, since it allows one to think ambitiously about a big project. I can also add that I never had any problem in developing a research program (although I am not sure that this is a consequence of having worked at a book-like MA thesis and then at a book-like PhD thesis).</p><p>By the way, we somehow discussed this topic already (<a href="https://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2013/06/how-do-you-find-ideas-for-your-article.html" rel="nofollow">http://elisafreschi.blogspot.co.at/2013/06/how-do-you-find-ideas-for-your-article.html</a> and <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2013/05/whats-your-process.html#comments)" rel="nofollow">http://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2013/05/whats-your-process.html#comments)</a></p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I wrote a book-type disseration, but did not develop my current research program from it. I had a post doc straight out of grad school, and the work I did there is what shaped my current research agenda, I was fortunate in that the post doc was in an area that is currently "trending," so to speak. However, it required me to shift gears pretty quickly, and that resulted in me pretty much leaving behind the diss and not doing anything to develop it into papers or a book.</p><p>I think the postdoc and the research I did there helped me a lot when it came to getting a TT job at a research university. Writing a coherent research statement that can explain what your research is about and why it matters is important, but you also need to have a publication record to back it up. </p><p>Something you don't address, but which a lot of young philosophers don't know, is that tenure requirements in some research schools (like mine) pretty much require you to specialize your research because they expect you to develop a national reputation by the time you go up for tenure. It's pretty hard to do that in 5.5 years if your work is not fairly focused. I would actually like to work on other things sometimes, but at this point in time I really need to work towards carving out a niche for myself that will be recognized. However, this might work against you if (like me) you are trying to move to a different job. It's easier to claim things as an AOS/AOC when your publications are not so narrowly focused. So, I have teaching competence in areas that I never get to teach at my current job, and some areas I think of as being in my AOS are areas I don't get to publish much in, because I spend all my time on the main foci of my research agenda.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>The chair at the research school where I got my PhD advised new profs there to focus on one line of research.  He encouraged them, as T-T-M says, to become known for something.  He didn't think they could if they tried to publish in two areas.  FWIW, most of the profs there did focus on one area, at least the younger ones.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Professor Arvan, if I may, I have a question. I start my Master's in the fall, and thus dissertation time is years away, but I was pleasantly surprised to learn about the option of writing several related papers instead of the book-length format dissertation. My initial thought was that, given that a dissertation would hopefully provide some material for initial publication, writing several essays would make it easier to do just that. Moreover, it also seems that the profession looks to the essay rather than the book as the paradigm of philosophical work. (I remember reading an interview where Robert Brandom from Pittsburgh said just that!) Wouldn't writing the essay dissertation better prepare a student to publish right after defense? I thought so, until I came upon this post, which made me reflect on the importance for a new philosopher to develop a (hopefully) coherent research program as he goes on the job market. In that case, the experience of managing a larger work may be more valuable, unless the students successfully manages to break a larger project into essay chunks while keeping a coherent big picture together.    </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hi Henry: Thanks for your inquiry. I think we need to distinguish two things:</p><p>(1) What is most likely to prepare a grad student to publish and get a job, viz. professionalization.</p><p>(2) What is best for a person's development as a *philosopher*. </p><p>I, for one, am no fan of how (overly) professionalized academic philosophy has become, or of how the discipline has become increasingly focused on articles rather than books.</p><p>In my view, both have had detrimental effects on philosophy. I got into philosophy because I was inspired by (A) big, bold, deep, systematic ideas, (B) written in books. I got into philosophy because of Kant's Groundwork and Critique of Pure Reason, Plato's Republic, Rawls' A Theory of Justice, Korsgaard's Creating the Kingdom of Ends, etc.. I did not get into philosophy because of little ideas written in little articles. </p><p>This isn't to say that articles are worthless. Far from it! I like writing articles myself. All it is to say is that--in my view--we should be suspicious of a professionalizing culture that emphasizes small ideas over big ones, little articles over big books, etc.</p><p>I would suggest, in other words, that you consider carefully who you want to be. If you want to be a good professional, get a job and all that, then maybe writing 3-4 papers for a dissertation is for you. However, if it is big ideas that do it for you--if you got into philosophy for the reasons I did--I would suggest going the traditional dissertation route. For, as difficult as it may be--and although it may not result in easy publications--it will give you something that (in my view) a 3-4 paper option can't give you: the challenge to develop a big, deep idea systematically. It's your choice, of course. The important thing, in my view, is that you know what you are choosing between!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='t'>Job Market Boot Camp, Part 8: The Cover Letter</h3><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Updated 5/4:</span> see section on ordering teaching and research.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now that we have examined <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/03/job-market-boot-camp-part-2-building-a-good-cv.html" target="_self">building</a> and <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-3-the-cv-itself.html" target="_self">composing</a> CVs, obtaining <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-4-letters-of-recommendation.html" target="_self">recommendation letters</a>, the <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/understanding-the-european-job-market-for-philosophers.html" target="_self">European job market</a>, <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-6-should-you-hire-a-job-market-consultant.html" target="_self">job-market consultants</a>, and <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-7-developing-coherent-research-programs.html" target="_self">developing a coherent research program</a>, I would like to move onto the rest of the standard job-market dossier materials, beginning with cover letters.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some readers might wonder why I'm going over dossier materials so early, given that it's only May and the main US job market doesn't heat up for several months for now. The answer is two-fold. First, foreign job markets are currently in full-swing. It seems like I'm receiving foreign job ads in my email box from the philos-l listserv on a daily basis. Second, even though the main US job season doesn't open for several months, it takes a long time to get one's dossier materials to get into the kind of shape they need to be in.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">All of which brings me to my first point: don't underestimate the importance of having really polished dossier materials. Search committees look at hundreds of applications--and you want to knock their socks off. You want your cover letter, research statement, teaching statement, and teaching portfolio to sparkle. The question then is how to do it.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The single most interesting thing I learned from working with a <a href="https://philosopherscocoon.typepad.com/blog/2015/04/job-market-boot-camp-part-6-should-you-hire-a-job-market-consultant.html" target="_self">job-market consultant</a> (someone who, for the record, served on many academic search committees) is that job-candidates systematically misunderstand what search committees are looking for in job-market materials. When I sent my consultant my materials--my cover letter template, research statement, and teaching statement--I was pretty sure they would be impressed. I could not have been more wrong. They told me, in no uncertain term, that I was doing <span style="text-decoration: underline;">everything</span> wrong, and that I'm not alone: candidate after candidate, they told me, writes their materials with the wrong aims in mind. How so?</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Let me begin with the most general point I learned. The most natural thing to think as a job candidate is that you need to "talk yourself up" to search committees--going on about how novel your research is, how passionate of a teacher you are, and so on. However, while this seems perfectly reasonable on its face (how are you supposed to convince a search committee to hire you if you don't make it crystal clear how awesome your research and teaching are?), the problem--or so I was told, and I totally buy it now--is that talking yourself up in your materials actually has the opposite effect: instead of making you look awesome, it makes you look like someone who is trying to convince them you're awesome--whereas a really awesome person will just let their work do the talking. Let me explain by way of an analogy.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">What's the best way to get a date? Should you come right out and profess your undying love to the object of your affections? Should you talk about all of your accomplishments? Of course not. These tactics will make you come across self-absorbed and/or desperate. You're far better off projecting a quiet air of confidence and nonchalance--of being comfortable in your own skin. Similarly, when it comes to job-marketeering, you want to come across to search committee members not as Someone Desperate to Belong, but rather as Someone Who Belongs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Before I was introduced to the job-market consultant who taught me this--and who got me to take out just about every self-aggrandizing word or phrase out of my materials in favor of flatly descriptive accounts of my research, teaching, etc.--a couple of my friends who utilized the consultant (to incredibly positive effect) showed me their letters. I was unimpressed. They seemed so flat to me. Where was the "selling" one's research and teaching? It was nowhere to be found. And yet...once I worked with the consultant, I totally got it. I revamped my materials in line with their advice and got a ton more interviews than I had ever gotten before. And so I now firmly believe: your primary aim in composing your cover letter, research statement, and teaching statement should <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span> be to "sell yourself." It should merely be to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">describe in detail</span> to your reader--the search committee member--exactly what your research is about, exactly how you teach, and so on. No editorializing, mere description. Mere description will (1) show the reader who you are (as a researcher, teacher, etc.), and (2) give them the impression that you are Someone Who Belongs.</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Now that we have this general point on the table, allow me to move onto specific parts of the cover letter (for reference, here is a link to my <a href="https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;pid=sites&amp;srcid=ZGVmYXVsdGRvbWFpbnwyMDEzcGNwY3xneDo1YTU3ODIyMWIyMzYxYjhm" target="_self">cover-letter template</a>  from last year):</p><p>Most letters should end there, with a quick "I look forward to hearing from you", or some such, as well as an invitation to visit your webpage (with a link) if they desire more information. Although you may be tempted to close your letter with a list of accomplishments--e.g. your work with students on-campus, etc.--avoid this temptation. They will see this stuff in your CV. </p><p>Other stuff for non-standard letters:</p><p>I guess that's all. Did I miss anything? Get anything wrong? Any thoughts or questions?

I understand the reasoning behind it, and it's great to hear that some people consider that a form of theft (!) But how exactly do you create a nice-looking letterhead without that? Do you just use a cool font/size/proportion for your own address at the top? I'm really just talking about the visual design issue here (more a rhetorical question than anything, i'm sure there are loads of examples on the internet I can crib).</p><p>Also, as for the tailoring/fit paragraph: in my own cover letter last year, I included a few vague sentences that I anticipated that my research would complement the department's strength in X  or Z. I did *not* list particular faculty members. Some people I asked thought even that vague statement was too presumptuous in a way... maybe it was TOO vague? And if I had specifically listed faculty members that would help? I'm fearful of somehow misinterpreting someone's current project (e.g., they've published a lot in X in the past but now no longer work on X at all), given how much publications can lag behind one's current interests..</p><p>Just thinking aloud--thanks again for all of these suggestions!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Anon: Thanks for your comment, and for the kind words. I was as shocked as you seem to be that anyone would consider using letterhead a form of theft--but there it was: at the blog I visited, several different faculty members said that's how they saw it. Seems crazy to me, but it still seems to me not worth risking.</p><p>As you can see from my letter, I didn't use any special font: just my name, address, institution, etc--all in normal size, ordinary font. And it didn't seem to hurt me at all (in terms of interviews). Personally, I think that if I learned anything at all from my work with the consultant and my performance on the market, it is that "design" can only hurt you, not help. Fancy designs may give off the scent of "trying too hard." Just focus on content. That, at the end of the day, is what SCs are looking for. They're not looking to hire someone with a pretty-looking cover letter or CV. They're looking to someone who comes across in the *content* of the letter, CV, etc., as someone they want to hire.</p><p>In terms of the tailoring/fit paragraph, I would suggest that "fearing to look presumptuous" is the exact opposite of the attitude you want to convey. You want to convey that you Belong. You show you Belong by treating the search committee members as *peers*, not people who have power over you. This--in my view--is one of the most important things I think I learned from the market: namely, that our "instincts" as candidates tend to be systematically the opposite of what they should be. It is natural to operate out of fear--wanting to avoid looking presumptuous etc. But acting out of fear is anathema to Showing You Belong. You show you belong through quiet confidence--and saying that you would look forward to working with faculty X, Y, and Z shows them that you see yourself as their peer.</p><p>Does that make sense? Even if the faculty member is no longer working on the stuff mentioned on their webpage, showing them that you know what they are up to and would look forward to working with them shows them that you have *confidence*--which seems to work on the job market in much the same way that it works in the dating world. Also, you can always check individuals' philpapers profiles to see what they have worked on recently. I did this, and referred to some people's recent work in some of my cover letters--and suspect it may have worked to good effect. *I* would probably be impressed by a candidate who showed familiarity with what I've been working on!</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Marcus: I got caught up in the mystery of "using letterhead is stealing" and did some internet searching. I've seen the various sites where people voice the opinion you mention. However, I've seen considerably more people denounce this as a ridiculous view point. My two cents: one is far less likely to face ethical criticism from search committee members who think use of letterhead is stealing (particularly when most cover letters are digital) than one is to face the implicit bias against a cover letter absent any visual institutional affiliation. There certainly seem to be people out there who think of letterhead use for job applications as illicit, but I'd be willing to bet that they are a slim minority rather than the general consensus. On the other hand, the unconscious positive bump your letter is likely to get from having an affiliation up front seems likely to be widespread rather than isolated. In a perfectly rational world I would advise that the safe choice is to submit without letterhead, but we all know that's not the world we live in. If one has an affiliation, I think the best bet is to use the letterhead and hope that you avoid the odd scholar here or there who thinks letterhead users are thieves. </p><p>Though perhaps you have more robust data than my 15 minutes of internet searching provides... </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>anon jtt: Thanks for your comment. I think it's hard to say. Maybe if you're in a prestigious post-doc or VAP, letterhead may give you a "first-look bump." Maybe. But that information (your affiliation) will be in your address and second or third sentence without letterhead. So, I sort of doubt that letterhead provides a "bump" that wouldn't be there without it, and having letterhead runs a risk of turning that *one* search committee member you need to get on your side to consider you a thief. To me, this incredible possible downside more than outweighs any marginal upside letterhead might provide (again, your institution will be highlighted in your address anyway!). Given that every search committee member counts--and pissing just one of them off might tank your application--it just doesn't seem to me worth risking. At any rate, I didn't use letterhead at all this year and I got more interviews than when I did. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I have never heard of the anti-letterhead bias! Having recently served on a search committee, I can say that it did not bother me in the least if an applicant used institutional letterhead. What did bug me was not bothering to use any kind of letterhead, and just launching into the letter. Perhaps my own bias, but it looks too informal. You're not writing a letter to your grandmother. If you want to look like a professional, it helps if your letter looks professional too.</p><p>Word and Pages both provide letterhead templates, any of which are fine, but just using a readable font and making your own works too.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Thanks for the very helpful advice/information Marcus. I am curious about what you'd recommend re: the length of the cover letter. My current cover letter template is just a single page. I've read and been told that anything more than this is typically too long, unless the job asks the applicant to address specific non-standard areas (e.g. university mission, religious affiliation, experience teaching students of diverse backgrounds etc..). If I adopted your six paragraph schema, I don't see how the cover letter could avoid being to pages. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>One note: for SLACs and other teaching-oriented places, I would consider have a longer teaching section, and perhaps a shorter research section -- and I would reverse the order of those sections in the letter (i.e. put teaching first).  </p><p>I think that this is directly related to Marcus's main principle: to show that you Belong at a SLAC, you need to show the faculty there that you take teaching very seriously.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hi, Marcus, many thanks for once again a very kind and helpful post. Is the letterhead aversion you discuss here a philosophy-specific thing? Are these bloggers you mention averse to letterheads even in cases in which the institution approves of their use? I hadn't been using a letterhead except I was recently converted into using it (influenced by web advice written by _the_ academic job consultant). My postdoc institution has provided me with the letterhead file precisely for job cover letters purposes. This eliminates the stealing worry, doesn't it?</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I think there is a risk to saying you want to collaborate etc with Prof. X. I had an on-campus interview and I specifically mentioned a particular professor's work that I was interested in. The other two faculty members I was with sort of looked at each other and then me and confessed that Prof. X was rarely available and they roughly transmitted that the dept doesn't get along with that person. It was awkward all around. I could see this happening in a letter as well. It came at little cost and I eventually got an offer, so this is minor, but I think it is worth thinking about. Here is an extreme case. Consider some of the now well known, ugly events in the discipline. Imagine you say 'I'd love to work with Prof. X'. Prof X, let's suppose, is a serious problem in the dept unbeknownst to you. A real shame if this were a deal breaker for an unknowing, well meaning job seeker, but it seems risky. Is it worth it?</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Hi Filippo: Thanks for your kind words. The people in question, if I recall, were not necessarily from philosophy--but if some people in one discipline are apt to consider it theft, then I see no reason why the worry should carry over into others. In terms of getting permission, it may of course eliminate the stealing worry on your end--but the search committee member won't have that information available to them. They still could think it is stealing even if you got permission, simply because they don't know that.</p><p>Look, I know it's a crazy worry--but since there were at least a few SC members on the blogs I visited to voiced their view that it is theft, *I* didn't think it was worth running the risk. And again, not using letterhead certainly didn't seem to hurt my prospects on the market. (If my experience not using letterhead wasn't so unequivocal--it didn't seem to hurt me getting interviews in the slightest--I would be a bit more cautious about advocating not using it.)</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Searched a few times and been on a committee once: </p><p>I suppose there is that risk. But, to me, the likely benefits outweigh that risk. Empirical psychology strongly suggests that in order to get hired, you need to get people to (subconsciously) *like* you. Although we all like to think that we are "objective" or judge people on their merits, psychology indicates that hiring--like most things in human life--are much more driven by *affective* (i.e. emotional) components than rational ones.</p><p>So, I say, when it comes to mentioning faculty X, Y, and Z by name, here are the benefits and risk:</p><p>(A) Likely benefit: if X, Y, and Z are on the committee, you'll endear yourselves to them. If X, Y, and Z are merely friends of committee members, you'll also endear yourself.</p><p>(B) Unlikely risk: everyone in the department hates X, and will despise your application if you mention them.</p><p>Given that I think the likely benefits here are much greater than the unlikely risk, I say one should go for it. For the opposite tack--not mentioning faculty by name--has *greater* likely risk and unlikely benefits, namely:</p><p>(C) Likely risk of not mentioning faculty by name: you don't mention X, Y, or Z by name, but other candidates do--and those candidates endear themselves to the SC members whereas you don't.</p><p>(D) Unlikely benefit of not mentioning faculty by name: everyone hates X, and you benefit by not mentioning them.</p><p>In short, there are risks to just about everything. To me, the likely benefits of mentioning faculty by name outweigh the risks.</p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>I'm a senior professor at a non-Leiterific department with a modest PhD program. Even though the job market is a nightmare and a job at my school is, on the whole, pretty desirable, we also know that, mostly, the best people from the best places are not likely to take us too seriously, except perhaps as a fallback place to land for the short term.  So, speaking for myself, if I'm reading a file from someone at a top-ranked school and the cover letter says nothing specific about our department, university, or town (other than a quick reference to the job number), I'm going to assume that the person isn't seriously interested (that doesn't mean I won't suggest we interview the person, however). So those letters that either note some kind of personal connection or that at least indicate that the applicant cared enough to look us up get my interest. And it can make a difference when push comes to shove at either the first or campus interview stage. Keep in mind that when you get hundreds of applications, you're looking for a reason to exclude people. </p><p>While I know that not all my colleagues view the matter as I do, I also know that I'm not alone. Furthermore, I think the point generalizes. If you're from a school with a good-but-not-great ranking and you are applying to, say, a small, regional state school with a 4-4 teaching load, and you are genuinely interested in teaching there, give the school a reason to think that's true. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>Quick question.

	</p><p>I know this is an old thread, but I hope you won't mind me asking a related question here. Re: adopting a merely descriptive tone, is it worth even mentioning, say, teaching prizes in a cover letter if they are also on the CV? On the one hand, it seems like it could be useful to bring up evidence of one's commitment to/excellence in teaching by talking about these sorts of things, but it also seems hard to do so without coming off as too self-aggrandizing. Any advice would be very welcome - thank you! </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">

	</p><p>VAP: Yes, I would mention it in the cover letter. A teaching prize seems to me *very* likely to be a real advantage in applying to teaching jobs...and it's always possible that someone might miss if it's just in your CV. </p><p class="comment-footer font-entryfooter">
