</p><p>The two-year deal with the US company covers “prime series” vaccines and future booster shots to protect against SARS-CoV-2 variants, Executive Yuan spokesman Lo Ping-cheng (羅秉成) quoted Premier Su Tseng-chang (蘇貞昌) as saying during an Executive Yuan meeting in Taipei.
</p><p>In the two weeks since vaccine registration opened, more than 9.8 million people have signed up, while Taiwan has received more than 8.9 million doses, Su said.
</p><p>Photo: Reuters</p><p>Thanks to the efforts of local governments, vaccination coverage reached 23.5 percent as of Wednesday, with more than 5.67 million people having received at least one dose, he added.
</p><p>Yesterday, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said that the rate had reached 24.35 percent.
</p><p>The original target of 25 percent coverage by the end of this month is likely to be attained ahead of schedule, Su said, adding that the government now hopes to reach 30 percent.
</p><p>Photo courtesy of the Taipei branch of Sankei Shimbun</p><p>More vaccine options are to be added on the registration site as soon as they arrive, he added, encouraging people to be vaccinated as soon as they are eligible.
</p><p>Buddhist Compassion Relief Tzu Chi Foundation on Wednesday agreeded to buy 5 million doses of BioNTech’s vaccine, which paired with similar purchases by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (台積電) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co (鴻海精密)-affiliated Yonglin Foundation, has brought contributions by private donors to 15 million doses, Su said.
</p><p>These donations are the “most selfless contribution to the nation,” he said, extending his gratitude to the organizations on the government’s behalf.
</p><p>With Medigen Vaccine Biologics Corp’s (高端疫苗) vaccine receiving emergency use authorization, new progress in obtaining vaccines is being made every week, he said.
</p><p>Su also thanked the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the Food and Drug Administration and other experts for their hard work in safeguarding the nation’s health through science and professionalism.
</p><p>In related news, a group of 88 businesses and organizations yesterday took out a full-page advertisement in <i>Sankei Shimbun</i> to thank Japan for its vaccine donations and to express their support on the eve of the Tokyo Olympic Games’ opening ceremony.
</p><p>The newspaper ad features a Formosan black bear and the Japanese folk hero Momotaro competing on the same tug-of-war team, with text saying that Taiwan will never forget Japan’s friendship during the pandemic.
</p><p>Japan has donated 3.34 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Taiwan in three batches since June 4.
</p><p>The Taiwan-Japan Cultural and Economic Association, which initiated the campaign, was founded in 1952 to facilitate exchanges between the two nations and boasts more than 200 members.
</p><p>The US has also donated 2.5 million doses of the Moderna vaccine to Taiwan.
</p><p>Lithuania last month pledged to donate 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Taiwan, while Slovakia last week also pledged to donate 10,000 vaccine doses to Taiwan through the European Civil Protection Mechanism, with the vaccine brand to be determined.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='d'>China rebuffs WHO’s terms for further virus study</h3><p>China cannot accept the WHO’s plan for the second phase of a study into the origins of COVID-19, a senior Chinese health official said yesterday.
</p><p>Chinese National Health Commission Vice Minister Zeng Yixin (曾益新) said he was “rather taken aback” that the plan includes further investigation of the theory that the virus might have leaked from a Chinese laboratory.
</p><p>He dismissed the lab leak idea as a rumor that runs counter to common sense and science.
</p><p>Photo: Reuters</p><p>“It is impossible for us to accept such an origin-tracing plan,” he said at a news conference called to address the COVID-19 origins issue.
</p><p>The search for where the virus came from has become a diplomatic issue. The US and others say that China has not been transparent about what happened in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic. China accuses critics of seeking to blame it for the pandemic and politicizing an issue that should be left to scientists.
</p><p>WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus last week said that there had been a “premature push” after the first phase of the study to rule out the theory that the virus might have escaped from a Chinese government lab in Wuhan, the city where the disease was first detected in late 2019.
</p><p>Most experts do not think a lab leak is the likely cause. The question is whether the possibility is so remote that it should be dropped, or whether it merits further study.
</p><p>The first phase was conducted earlier this year by an international team of scientists who traveled to Wuhan to work with their Chinese counterparts. The team was accused of bowing to demands from the Chinese side after it initially indicated that further study was not necessary.
</p><p>Zeng said the Wuhan lab has no virus that can directly infect humans and that the WHO team concluded that a lab leak was highly unlikely.
</p><p>The WHO team concluded that the virus most likely jumped from animals to humans, probably from bats to an intermediate animal. The experts visited markets in Wuhan that had sold live animals, and recommended further study of the farms that supplied the market.
</p><p>“In the next step, I think animal tracing should still be the priority direction. It is the most valuable field for our efforts,” said Liang Wannian (梁萬年), who headed the Chinese side.
</p><p>Tedros said last week that he hoped for better cooperation and access to data from China.
</p><p>“We are asking China to be transparent, open and cooperate, especially on the information, raw data that we asked for in the early days of the pandemic,” he said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='t'>Typhoon In-Fa to bring heavy rain to north</h3><p>Residents of northern Taiwan should brace for heavy rain today and tomorrow as Typhoon In-Fa approaches the northeast, the Central Weather Bureau (CWB) said yesterday.
</p><p>A land alert for the typhoon would be issued depending on the angle at which it moves north today, the bureau said.
</p><p>The bureau on Wednesday issued a sea alert for the typhoon, which applies to ships operating off the nation’s northern, northeastern and southeastern coasts.
</p><p></p><p>As of 8:30pm yesterday, In-Fa’s center was 470km southeast of Taipei, moving northwest at 6kph. It was carrying maximum sustained winds of 180kph, and had a radius of 200km.
</p><p>The typhoon was moving rather slowly due to the lack of a clear guiding airstream, bureau forecaster Hsieh Pei-yun (謝佩芸) said, adding that the CWB forecast that it would be near the southern coast of Japan’s Miyako Island this morning.
</p><p>While humidity at sea allows the typhoon to develop, In-Fa would maintain its current level of intensity when it approaches Taiwan and slowly turns north today as a Pacific high-pressure system subsides, Hsieh said.
</p><p>Photo: CNA</p><p>“The angle at which it turns as it moves north would be key in determining how the storm would affect the nation,” she said, when asked about the possibility of the bureau issuing a land alert.
</p><p>“If the typhoon veers to the east after it turns north, the radius of the storm would not reach Taiwan,” Hsieh said.
</p><p>The typhoon is to accelerate and move away from Taiwan tomorrow, she said.
</p><p>Intermittent rain began to fall in the northern and northeastern regions yesterday, Hsieh said, adding that extremely heavy rain is forecast for mountainous areas in northern Taiwan today.
</p><p>Showers are forecast for central, southern and eastern Taiwan.
</p><p>The bureau issued an extremely heavy rain alert to residents of Taoyuan and Hsinchu County, as well as mountainous areas in Taipei, New Taipei City, Miaoli and Yilan counties.
</p><p>By 5pm yesterday, Hsinchu County’s Beipu Township (北埔) had the nation’s highest accumulated rainfall of 298.5mm, followed by 222mm at Taoyuan’s Shihmen Reservoir (石門水庫), 220mm in Miaoli County’s Nanjhuang Township (南庄) and 210mm in Yilan County’s Taipingshan (太平山), bureau data showed.
</p><p>On Sunday, a southwest wind would rise again after the typhoon arrives in China, making the weather in central and southern Taiwan unstable, Hsieh said.
</p><p>Five domestic flights and two international flights were canceled yesterday due to In-Fa, the Civil Aeronautics Administration said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='a'>Canadian security think tank to host forum in Taiwan</h3><p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday welcomed the Halifax International Security Forum’s announcement that it would host its first major event in Asia from Jan. 21 to Jan. 23 next year in Taipei, after it earlier presented a leadership prize to President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文).
</p><p>The Washington-based group of security officials from the world’s democratic states has said it would cohost HFX Taipei with the Institute for National Defense and Security Research.
</p><p>In May, the group awarded Tsai the 2020 John McCain Prize for Leadership in Public Service in recognition of her handling of COVID-19 and guarding Taiwan’s democracy, which sparked ire from Beijing.
</p><p>Photo: Liu Hsin-de, Taipei Times</p><p>HFX Taipei would be Halifax’s first major meeting in Asia, and underscores that Taiwan is a democratic state and participant in the affairs of the region, the ministry said in a news release.
</p><p>The ministry would work with Halifax and the institute to ensure the success of the event, which would help Taiwan and like-minded partners defend shared democratic values, it said.
</p><p>The meeting would be attended by internationally recognized opinion leaders, the institute said in a statement.
</p><p>Since its establishment by the Ministry of National Defense in 2018, the institute has promoted “think tank diplomacy” with counterparts in other states, including Australia, India, Japan, New Zealand, the UK and the US, as well as European countries, it said.
</p><p>Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lawmakers hailed the news as a sign of improving ties with the world’s powerful democracies.
</p><p>“The [Halifax] think tank is heavily funded by the Canadian government,” DPP Legislator Wang Ting-yu (王定宇) said. “The HFX Taipei forum is effectively a form of semi-official cooperation between the two state-level think tanks.”
</p><p>Politico had reported that the Canadian government had warned the forum not to give the award to Tsai for fear of angering Beijing. Canada denied the report.
</p><p>After many US senators and Canadian representatives voiced support for the forum’s decision, it presented the award to Tsai.
</p><p>DPP Legislator Lo Chih-cheng (羅致政) said the institute would discuss security issues regarding China at the forum.
</p><p>“This shows that the world’s democracies are coming together to resist totalitarian China,” he said.
</p><p>That Canadian lawmakers have stood by the forum in honoring Tsai suggests that Canadians’ views on China have changed, he said.
</p><p>Beijing’s “wolf warrior” diplomacy and saber-rattling is not likely to have an effect on that country, he added.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='d'>China indirectly thanks Tsai for concerns over floods</h3><p>The Chinese government yesterday offered an indirect thank you to President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) for her message of concern over devastating floods in Henan Province, in a rare show of goodwill between Beijing and Taipei.
</p><p>Thirty-three people have died so far from heavy rains that have deluged Henan and its capital, Zhengzhou, for almost a week.
</p><p>Tsai on Wednesday, through her spokesman, expressed concern and sent her condolences to the victims.
</p><p>Photo: AFP</p><p>“President Tsai extends her sympathies and condolences to the flood victims and hopes life can return to normal soon for the survivors,” Presidential Office spokesman Xavier Chang (張惇涵) told reporters.
</p><p>In a brief statement, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office expressed its thanks to “relevant parties in Taiwan and people from all walks of life who have expressed their concern and condolences to the disaster-stricken area through various forms.”
</p><p>It also thanked Taiwanese companies for donating money and materials for disaster relief.
</p><p>Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Chairman Johnny Chiang (江啟臣) also expressed his condolences for the floods, as did Vice President William Lai (賴清德).
</p><p>“In this disaster that has hit the Chinese people, we sincerely hope there will be no more casualties in the flooded areas and all those affected will weather the difficult times,” Lai wrote on Facebook yesterday.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Zhengzhou residents yesterday were shoveling mud from their homes and hauling away wrecked vehicles and piles of destroyed belongings, as rains continued to pound parts of Henan.
</p><p>Streets have been turned into rivers and people were stranded in apartments, offices, hotels and rural homes in dozens of cities and towns.
</p><p>In the worst incident in Zhengzhou, 12 people died on Tuesday night in the subway system when it was inundated with floodwater.
</p><p>Another eight people remain missing in the floods, Xinhua news agency reported.
</p><p>Xinxiang saw its heaviest rainfall in recorded history, with more than 25cm in 19 hours between Wednesday night and yesterday afternoon, according to the city’s weather agency.
</p><p>The local government has urged people not to leave their homes unless necessary.

</p><p>Of the local cases, 15 were men and 15 were women, with the onset of symptoms reported between Saturday and Wednesday, the center said.
</p><p>Taipei and New Taipei City recorded 11 cases each, Taoyuan had seven cases and Hsinchu City had one, it said.
</p><p>Photo: Yang Yuan-ting, Taipei Times</p><p>Twenty-four of the local cases had known sources of infection, five had unclear links with confirmed cases and one was under investigation, it said.
</p><p>Despite the relatively high number of cases yesterday, the COVID-19 situation “is still under control,” Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the center, said at the CECC’s daily news conference in Taipei.
</p><p>The center reported 16 domestic cases on Wednesday, 18 on Tuesday, 15 each on Monday and Sunday, eight on Saturday and 29 on Friday last week.
</p><p>The new imported cases include a Taiwanese boy under the age of 10 who returned from China on July 8, the center said.
</p><p>He had no symptoms since his arrival, the center said, adding that one contact of the boy has been ordered to isolate.
</p><p>Another imported case is an American man in his 20s who arrived from the US on Tuesday for work, the center said. 
</p><p>He had no symptoms since his arrival, and five passengers on his flight have been asked to isolate, it added.
</p><p>The third imported case is a Taiwanese man in his 20s who returned from the United Arab Emirates on Tuesday, the center said.
</p><p>On Wednesday, he developed a cough, dizziness and a slightly elevated body temperature, it said, adding that health authorities have arranged for his treatment and contact tracing is under way.
</p><p>The deaths were two men and two women, aged 60 to 79, who were confirmed to have COVID-19 between June 4 and June 29, it said.
</p><p>They died between Monday and Wednesday, the center said, adding that all four had chronic health conditions.
</p><p>One of them — a woman in her 70s who died on Wednesday — was infected with the Delta variant of SARS-CoV-2 and is the nation’s first death from that variant, said Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Philip Lo (羅一鈞), who is deputy head of the CECC’s medical response division.
</p><p>The course of her infection had not been particularly different from that of patients with other variants, he said. 
</p><p>As of yesterday, Taiwan had recorded 15,511 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1,253 imported and 14,205 domestic cases, and 782 deaths, CECC data showed.
</p><p>The center said that 14,255 cases were reported between May 11 and Tuesday, adding that 12,456 of them, or 87.4 percent, have recovered.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the CECC said that community-based dementia care centers would be allowed to resume services as long as they follow guidelines for COVID-19 prevention and management set by the Ministry of Health and Welfare.
</p><p>Care center staff, patients and those accompanying them must have either received their first dose of COVID-19 vaccine at least 14 days prior to entering the facility, or provide a negative test report from within three days of entering, the CECC said.
</p><p>The guidelines also include measures that facilities should take under different COVID-19 alert levels, as well as how they should respond in the event of a suspected or confirmed COVID-19 case at the facility.
</p><p>Separately yesterday, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) said that the ministry and the Taipei Economic and Trade Office in Indonesia are in talks with several airlines about the possibility of arranging a charter flight to return Taiwanese from the country hit hard by a wave of COVID-19 infections. 
</p><p>Ou’s remarks came after a report that a Batik Air charter flight arranged by an Indonesia-based Taiwanese business association for Wednesday next week was canceled due to scheduling issues.
</p><p>About 120 people had registered for the flight, including 21 based in severely affected East Java Province, the report said.

</p><p>After 41 COVID-19 cases were identified on July 2 at Huannan Market in Wanhua District (萬華), the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) and the Taipei City Government formed a joint command mission to bring the situation under control.
</p><p>The command mission, which was led by Hospital and Social Welfare Organizations Administration Commission Director Victor Wang (王必勝), was disbanded on July 10 after the outbreak was contained.
</p><p>Photo: Screen grab from Youtube</p><p>Asked by media personality Frances Huang (黃光芹) in a YouTube interview yesterday why he did not respond to Chen’s offer to “take charge” until the Huannan Market outbreak, Ko said: “Take charge? How did they take charge? Everything was done by us.”
</p><p>Every time the command mission convened, CECC officials “just came to take a look and talk,” but every order was carried out by the city government, Ko said.
</p><p>“Go ask Victor Wang what contributions he made,” Ko responded when pressed to say whether the central government had any real utility.
</p><p>Asked about the matter at yesterday’s CECC news conference, Chen, who heads the center, said that the central and local governments are partners in fighting COVID-19.
</p><p>“If said about an individual, these comments would be a little unkind,” he said. “Everyone should be helping each other.”
</p><p>Later yesterday, Wang wrote on Facebook that he “never thought about” his own contributions to fighting the COVID-19 pandemic.
</p><p>“I have been to many places to help handle outbreaks and have met many different groups,” he said. “While on duty, only two things are on my mind: quickly getting the outbreak under control and making sure it does not happen again.”
</p><p>Wang said that he had inadvertently become good friends with the people he works with every day tracking and managing the pandemic.
</p><p>He thanked those with whom he worked closely in Taipei, including Deputy Taipei Mayor Vivian Huang (黃珊珊), as well as those working quietly behind the scenes.
</p><p>Wang also shared three photographs taken after a command mission meeting, showing Centers for Disease Control officials checking registration lists of vendors at Huannan Market.
</p><p>“These doctors are very professional and have given their all to the long process of fighting the pandemic,” he said. “They are national treasures.”
</p><p>Meanwhile, New Taipei City Mayor Hou You-yi (侯友宜) said that the regular beginning of the school year in September would depend on case counts and vaccination rates.
</p><p>Ko earlier said that Taipei expects to start the new school year as scheduled.
</p><p>New Taipei City would work toward reopening schools as scheduled, but it depends on the pandemic, Hou said.
</p><p>As for preschools and after-school centers, Hou said that discussions are under way about reopening the facilities on Monday next week under the condition that they implement appropriate disease prevention measures.
</p><p>Asked about Ko’s call on the government to purchase enough vaccines to administer a third dose to residents, Hou said that he had already asked the government to do so a few weeks ago.
</p><p>Vaccines are a question for science, not politics, Hou said, adding that he hopes the Medigen COVID-19 vaccine would be certified according to transparent, scientific standards.
</p><p>It is up to experts to decide, “not me or anyone else,” he added.

</p><p>People who booked an appointment through the central vaccine appointment platform 1922.gov.tw for a day on which inoculations are suspended due to a typhoon would retain their eligibility, Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC, told the center’s daily news conference in Taipei.
</p><p>They would receive another text message informing them to log onto the platform again and schedule a new appointment, the CECC said.
</p><p>They should be able to receive their COVID-19 vaccination the following week, Chen said, urging residents of potentially typhoon-affected areas not to worry.
</p><p>People who booked an appointment online or by telephone directly with a healthcare facility should reschedule their vaccinations according to the facility’s procedure, the center said.
</p><p>The CECC also reminded healthcare facilities and local health authorities to prepare for the approaching typhoon and to ensure that their refrigerated vaccine storage would remain operational in the event of a power outage.
</p><p>The center might postpone vaccine distribution today and tomorrow, depending on typhoon warnings, it said.
</p><p>As of Wednesday, 5,894,500 vaccine doses had been administered — 5,718,272 first doses and 176,228 second doses, CECC data showed.
</p><p>The center said that 24.35 percent of the population had been vaccinated, or 25.1 doses per 100 people.
</p><p>To encourage more healthcare facilities to offer vaccinations, the CECC would increase its administrative payment to local healthcare facilities for COVID-19 vaccinations from NT$40 to NT$100 per dose, Chen said.
</p><p>That would be on top of a NT$100 handling fee facilities receive per jab, as well as monetary rewards the CECC offers based on the number of doses administered, he said.

</p><p>A government program including subsidies for people with reduced or no income due to the pandemic has been criticized, as the payments are not expected to start until January next year.
</p><p>Foundation chief executive officer Lu Ping-yi (呂秉怡) said that the subsidy applications require a landlord’s signature, which they might not be willing to give.
</p><p>The requirement would prevent many people in need from applying, Lu said, adding that the program also did not address other pressing issues concerning living arrangements during the pandemic.
</p><p>An immediate subsidy is needed, he said.
</p><p>Lo Chih-chiang (羅智強), director of the KMT-affiliated Institute of Revolutionary Practice, said that government subsidies and other measures have been ineffective, as they are based on premises that are out of touch with reality.
</p><p>Tenants would not be eligible for a tax deduction as long as their landlord does not provide them with paperwork needed to include rental fees in their tax filings, he said, adding that landlords rarely provide the document.
</p><p>Slow procedures on the part of the government are hampering a quick solution to the problem, he said, urging the government to draw up new and more direct measures.
</p><p>KMT Legislator Lin Szu-ming (林思銘) said that the government has not been able to address the problems Taiwanese face in the rental market, despite continued input from the Legislative Yuan, including calls for a rental market census.
</p><p>A census would provide the data that a better subsidy policy could be based upon, he said.
</p><p>The KMT’s legislative caucus would continue pushing for an online database on rental fees and other measures to make the market more transparent and help protect the rights of tenants, Lin said.

</p><p>“Premier Su has asked the Ministry of Education to determine whether athletes and their coaches were seated in business class. Sports Administration officials must sit in economy class and stay at hotels that are the same quality as the athletes’ hotels,” Lo said.
</p><p>Su and Pan care deeply about athletes and their careers, Lo said, adding that Su was a rugby player and Pan was an athlete as well.

</p><p>While Olympic athletes being seated in economy class sparked a public furor, pan-blue politicians placed the blame on the president and the DPP government, saying that they had betrayed the athletes’ trust and deceived the public.

</p><p>CTOC president Lin Hong-dow (林鴻道) is the second-generation owner of property-development conglomerate Hung Kuo Corp (宏國建設) and his mother, Lin Hsieh Han-chien (林謝罕見), was a high-ranking KMT official, Chen said.
</p><p>CTOC vice president Chen Shyh-kwei (陳士魁) was Executive Yuan secretary-general under former president Ma Ying-jeou (馬英九), while CTOC top adviser Sun Lih-chyun (孫立群) was Executive Yuan spokesman under Ma, Chen added. 
</p><p>Sports in Taiwan need transitional justice, Chen said. 
</p><p>“Changes must be made to allow new members and the younger generation into these sports bodies,” Chen said. 
</p><p>KMT-affiliated officials take up the top posts, not because of their sports expertise or experience in sports business, but because of their loyalty to the KMT during the party’s authoritarian regime, he said. 
</p><p>DPP Legislator Rosalia Wu (吳思瑤) said that many athletes and citizens are demanding that the CTOC and Taiwan’s other sports governing bodies have greater transparency and better accountability, including calls for another round of sports reform, following amendments to the National Sports Act (國民體育法) in 2017. 
</p><p>The Sports Administration allocated NT$150 million (US$5.35 million) to the CTOC, which decided on how to spend the money without lawmakers or the public, Wu said.
</p><p>“These entrenched problems keep recurring, especially with the CTOC, where Olympic athletes get angered and complain to the public,” Huang said. “So it is once again time to push for reform at the CTOC and other sports governing bodies, to make changes and make them more accountable and transparent.”</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='a'>US senators propose Taiwan-US soldier program</h3><p>A bipartisan group of 13 US senators has introduced a resolution calling for the establishment of a partnership program between the US National Guard and Taiwan’s defense forces “for fast deployment during a crisis.”
</p><p>US senators Rick Scott, Tammy Duckworth and John Cornyn were among the lawmakers who introduced the legislation, titled the Taiwan partnership act, in the US Senate on Tuesday.
</p><p>Identical legislation was filed in the US House of Representatives.
</p><p>The resolution urges the creation of a partnership between the US National Guard and Taiwan’s defense forces to “ensure a well-integrated defense force capable of fast deployment during a crisis,” Scott said in a statement.
</p><p>The non-binding measure calls for increasing exchanges between defense officials and military personnel of the two nations, with the goal of enhancing Taiwan’s reserve forces and improving interoperability among its military branches.
</p><p>Taiwan faces a growing level of “aggression” from Beijing, making it imperative for the US to make clear that it stands with Taiwan in defense of its democracy, Scott added.
</p><p>“This legislation carries an important message to [Chinese Communist Party] General Secretary Xi [Jinping, 習近平] that we will not tolerate his threats against Taiwan’s autonomy,” he said.
</p><p>Duckworth, a National Guard veteran who visited Taipei last month, said that the bill would evaluate ways to enhance cooperation with Taiwan, which she called “an important strategic partner for the US in the Indo-Pacific region.”
</p><p>The National Guard is “ideally suited” to partner with Taiwan in areas such as emergency response, cyberdefense, education, cultural exchanges and advisory programs, she said.
</p><p>In Taipei, Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Joanne Ou (歐江安) yesterday thanked the US Congress members for their continued support of Taiwan.
</p><p>The ministry would watch the bill’s development, and maintain close contact with its friends in the US Congress and administration in a bid to continue to deepen their bilateral partnership, Ou said.
</p><p>Meanwhile, senior diplomats from the US, Japan and South Korea met in Tokyo on Wednesday to discuss issues ranging from North Korea and COVID-19 responses to the situation in the Taiwan Strait.
</p><p>US Department of State spokesman Ned Price said that Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman held talks with her counterparts, Japanese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Takeo Mori and South Korean Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Choi Jong-kun.
</p><p>Regarding Taiwan, they affirmed the need to maintain regional peace, unimpeded commerce and adherence to international law, “including freedom of navigation in the South China Sea and beyond,” Price said.
</p><p>The discussion also emphasized the “importance of preserving peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait,” he added.

</p><p><strong>Firm files over bunkers</strong>
</p><p>A renewable energy firm building a solar farm in Pingtung County’s Fangliao Township (枋寮) has requested that the county protect World War II-era bunkers on the construction site as cultural heritage. Shengli Energy in September last year uncovered Japanese bunkers while preparing the ground for the solar farm. The bunkers were connected to a larger system of fortifications built toward the end of 1945 by the Japanese military to shield Taiwan from an Allied invasion that never came. Last month, the county rejected a filing by conservationists to list the bunkers as a heritage site on a technicality, but without contesting that the fortification might have cultural value. Shengli Energy is renewing the historical heritage filing for two pillboxes, an observation post and connecting tunnels inside the project area, firm spokeswoman Chang Shu-wen (張淑雯) said. However, the discovery has fueled local opposition to the project. Opponents to the project said that they are also concerned that trees are being cut down to make room for the solar panels, which could make the area more vulnerable to landslides. Lin Yang-chu (林洋助), director of the county’s cultural heritage office, said that the agency has opened bids for experts to evaluate the fortifications’ cultural value and advise the county on their preservation.

</p><p><strong>Crack down on teen vapers</strong>
</p><p>People under the age of 18 will not be permitted to buy or smoke electronic cigarettes in New Taipei City when a new ordinance takes effect early next month, the city government said yesterday. The ordinance on e-cigarettes was passed by the New Taipei City Council on April 29 and is expected to take effect on Aug. 6, two days after it is to be promulgated, the city said. When it takes effect, vapers under the age of 18 would be required to enroll in a program to help them quit smoking if they caught carrying or smoking e-cigarettes in New Taipei City, the city’s Department of Health said in a statement. Offenders who skip the programs without a valid reason would face fines of up to NT$10,000 (US$357), the department said, adding that individuals or businesses found selling e-cigarettes or other vaping devices to people under the age of 18 would risk a fine of up to NT$100,000.

</p><p><strong>Garlic price riseo censured</strong>
</p><p>The Control Yuan on Wednesday censured the Council of Agriculture for a spike in garlic prices from July to September last year. Control Yuan member Chen Chin-jun (陳景峻) conducted the investigation that led to the censure, the Control Yuan said in a news release. Early last year, the wholesale price of garlic was NT$170 per kilogram, but then its price skyrocketed to as much as NT$400 per kilogram in some locations, it said, citing Chen’s report. The price hike occurred after large shipments of imported garlic were rejected for being contaminated, but the council’s failure to react to warnings on multiple occasions compounded supply shortages, the report said. Local farmers’ cooperatives discovered the contamination, which had slipped through customs, it said. The Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine failed to share the information with the council’s Agriculture and Food Agency, it said. Prices of garlic steadily rose in subsequent months, but the council’s inactivity continued until Aug. 6, it said. The council did not carry out its duty to protect consumers, it added.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br></div></div></body></html>
