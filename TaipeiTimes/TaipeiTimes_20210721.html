</p><p>“It is an important diplomatic breakthrough,” President Tsai Ing-wen (蔡英文) wrote on Facebook, thanking diplomatic personnel for the significant achievement.
</p><p>To expand the nation’s relations with central and eastern Europe, especially with Baltic nations, the government decided to establish the office in Vilnius, Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Wu (吳釗燮) told an online news conference.
</p><p>Photo: Reuters</p><p>The plan signals progress in Taiwan-Europe relations, as it has been 18 years since the nation last opened an office on the continent, the Taipei Representative Office in Bratislava, Slovakia, Wu said.
</p><p>Taiwan and Lithuania are both situated on the front lines of defending democracy and freedom, he said.
</p><p>A member of the EU and NATO, Lithuania is known for its strength in lasers, biotechnology, satellites and information technology, as well as agriculture and furniture, Wu said.
</p><p>When the Taiwan Representative Office in the Republic of Somaliland opened last year, it was the first to use the name “Taiwan,” he said.
</p><p>The planned office in Vilnius would be the first in Europe that is called “Taiwanese,” a nomenclature similar to the names of the British Office Taipei, the French Office in Taipei, the German Institute Taipei and the American Institute in Taiwan (AIT), he added.
</p><p>The nation’s representative offices in countries without formal relations mostly use the word “Taipei,” such as the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office in the US. Embassies in nations with formal ties use “Republic of China.”
</p><p>The ministry is seeking a suitable location for the planned office, Wu said when asked about the inauguration date.
</p><p>“Freedom-loving people should look out for each other,” he said, quoting Lithuanian Minister of Foreign Affairs Gabrielius Landsbergis, who on June 22 confirmed that his government planned to donate 20,000 doses of the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine to Taiwan.
</p><p>Lithuania plans to establish a trade office in Taiwan by the end of this year.
</p><p>Following the news conference, the AIT issued a statement backing the plan to establish the office in Lithuania.
</p><p>“All countries should be free to pursue closer ties and greater cooperation with Taiwan, a leading democracy, a major economy, and a force for good in the world,” the AIT said. “The United States remains committed to supporting Taiwan in a manner consistent with the US ‘one China’ policy as Taiwan strengthens its international partnerships and works to address global challenges, including COVID-19, investment screening, and supply chain resilience.”
</p><p>The Taipei Mission in the Republic of Latvia is currently responsible for promoting relations with Baltic nations, including Lithuania and Estonia.
</p><p>A video released by the mission yesterday showed Representative to Latvia Eric Huang (黃鈞耀) meeting Matas Maldeikis, chairman of the Lithuanian Parliamentary Group for Relations with Taiwan, in front of Vilnius Cathedral, making a toast with Taiwanese bubble tea purchased at a local shop.
</p><p>Taiwan and Lithuania share many parallels in history and geopolitics, and the office’s establishment would open a new chapter of bilateral economic cooperation and send a clear message that democracies must cooperate in the current geopolitical turbulence, Maldeikis said in the video.
</p><p>Taiwan maintains formal diplomatic relations with 15 allies, with the Vatican being the only one in Europe.
</p><p>Since taking office in May 2016, Tsai’s administration has lost seven diplomatic allies.
</p><p>Taiwan last year opened the office in Somaliland and the Taipei Representative Office in France’s new branch in Aix-en-Provence. It also resumed operations at the Taipei Economic and Cultural Office in Guam after a hiatus of three years.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='U'>KMT files lawsuit on domestic vaccine EUA</h3><p>The Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) yesterday filed a lawsuit against Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中) and Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Director Wu Shou-mei (吳秀梅) alleging corruption in the decision to issue an emergency use authorization (EUA) for the COVID-19 vaccine developed by the Medigen Vaccine Biologic Corp (高端疫苗生物製劑).
</p><p>The FDA had bypassed standard procedures and, in broad defiance of public and international opinion, decided to approve the vaccine, the KMT said.
</p><p>Citing FDA data, KMT caucus secretary-general Cheng Li-wun (鄭麗文) said that Medigen started producing vaccines last month, before it received the EUA, which is evidence that the company was given assurances that its vaccine would be approved and made available for use by next month.
</p><p>Photo: CNA</p><p>“We have become the only nation to approve an EUA for a vaccine that has not passed phase 3 clinical trials,” Cheng said.
</p><p>Medigen yesterday said that it had received approval to conduct  phase 3 clinical trials on 1,000 people in Paraguay.
</p><p>KMT Chairman Johnny Chiang (江啟臣) cited the vaccine approval process in the US, saying that the process is recorded and that its review processes are transparent.
</p><p>Taiwan, on the other hand, had not recorded the review process, he said, adding that the public does not know who attended the meeting, or what kind of opposition was voiced.
</p><p>“We have set the lowest bar for vaccine approval worldwide,” Chiang said.
</p><p>KMT Disciplinary Committee director Yeh Ching-yuan (葉慶元), who is the party’s legal representative, said that the procedures to approve domestic vaccines went against past practice, despite Taiwan having access to international vaccines and having no immediate need for them.
</p><p>The FDA was guilty of corruption as it forced through the approval of the EUA by replacing half of the academics on the panel of specialists, Yeh said.
</p><p>In response, Democratic Progressive Party caucus secretary-general Lo Chih-cheng (羅致政) said that the legislature would declassify and make public the minutes of the specialists’ meeting within two weeks.
</p><p>At the specialists’ meeting, 18 members voted to approve the vaccine, one voted for further discussion after asking for more information and one voted to not approve the vaccine, Wu said on Monday, adding that the convener of the meeting was not allowed to vote.
</p><p>Under the EUA, the company must provide a safety report every month, she said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='y'>Sea alert for In-Fa could be issued today, CWB says</h3><p>A sea alert for Typhoon In-Fa could be issued this morning as it moves toward Taiwan, although it remains uncertain if its center would make landfall, the Central Weather Bureau said yesterday.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Tropical Storm Cempaka was upgraded to a typhoon yesterday morning as it moved north toward China’s Guangdong Province, the bureau said.
</p><p>As of 2pm yesterday, In-Fa was classified as a tropical storm and was centered 800km east of Taipei, moving west at 13kph with maximum sustained winds of 101kph.
</p><p>Photo: Lu Hsien-hsiu, Taipei Times</p><p>It was upgraded to a moderate typhoon at 8pm yesterday evening.
</p><p>In other news, the bureau yesterday announced that it had completed the installation and renovation of 576 automatic weather observation stations nationwide.
</p><p>The 14-year project had cost NT$290 million (US$10.33 million), the bureau said.
</p><p>Photo courtesy of the Central Weather Bureau via CNA</p><p>The automatic system, including 437 weather observation stations and 139 rain observation stations, would enable the agency to collect meteorological data that could be used to prevent damage and casualties caused by flooding, mudflows and landslides, it said.
</p><p>The bureau has since 1985 budgeted funding annually to build the 24-hour automatic weather observation system, it said.
</p><p>By 2005, 257 rain observation stations and 119 weather observation stations had been installed.
</p><p>Between 2006 and last year, the bureau gradually retired old stations and installed new ones, it said.
</p><p>With advances in weather forecast technology, the bureau also upgraded some of the rain observation stations so that they are able to monitor changes in temperature, humidity, air pressure and wind speed.
</p><p>That helped raise the density of observation stations nationwide, it added.
</p><p>The system not only enhances the efficiency of the weather forecast service, it also enables the agency to more accurately forecast occurrences of topography-induced weather, such as high temperatures in the East Rift Valley between Hualien and Taitung, strong precipitation in the mountainous areas of New Taipei City, and Yilan and Pingtung counties, as well as katabatic wind in the Hengchun Peninsula.
</p><p>Weather data collected by the system would allow the agency to issue timely alerts for typhoons and other extreme weather events, and it can also be used in scientific research, the bureau said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='a'>First Hong Kong national security trial wraps up in test for rule of law</h3><p>The trial of the first person charged under Hong Kong’s National Security Law wrapped up yesterday, with the prosecution seeking to designate a slogan popular during 2019 protests as subversive in a crucial test of the territory’s rule of law.
</p><p>Former waiter Tong Ying-kit (唐英杰), 24, has pleaded not guilty to charges of terrorism, inciting secession and dangerous driving causing grievous bodily harm on July 1 last year, shortly after the law was enacted.
</p><p>As the first national security case conducted in open court, Tong’s case could set precedents on the handling of national security law cases for the more than 120 other people charged, including prominent democracy advocates.
</p><p>Photo: AP</p><p>The verdict is to be delivered on Tuesday next week by a panel of three judges — Esther Toh (杜麗冰), Anthea Pang (彭寶琴) and Wilson Chan (陳嘉信) — who were picked by Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam (林鄭月娥) to hear national security cases.
</p><p>Tong faces up to life in prison, as set out in the law. Someone convicted of a “grave” national security offense could be jailed for at least 10 years, the law says.
</p><p>Tong was denied bail and a jury, factors that stoked concern among Western governments and rights groups as a significant departure from century-old common law traditions.
</p><p>The court had cited the safety of jurors and their family members in denying trial by jury. Defense lawyers argued that the right to a jury was a “hallowed principle” of the common law system.
</p><p>On July 1 last year, a day after the law came into effect, Tong rode a motorcycle with the protest slogan “Liberate Hong Kong, Revolution of Our Times” fluttering on a flag from the back as he drove into a group of police officers, injuring three of them.
</p><p>He was arrested and charged with “incitement to secession,” as well as terrorism and dangerous driving.
</p><p>Tong has pleaded not guilty to all charges.
</p><p>The interpretation of the protest slogan, which was spray-painted on walls and chanted regularly during protests that roiled the territory in 2019, has been at the heart of the trial.
</p><p>In his closing submission, government prosecutor Anthony Chau (周天行) argued that Tong had displayed the flag to incite others to commit secession, including protesters gathered nearby, some of whom clapped as Tong rode past.
</p><p>He also said that Tong had used his motorcycle as a “lethal weapon” and the slogan on his flag showed he was “pursuing a political agenda.”
</p><p>The government has long held that the slogan suggests a call for independence, which would contravene the National Security Law, although no legal ruling has been made on that interpretation.
</p><p>Tong’s defense lawyer, Clive Grossman, yesterday said that it was a phrase with “multiple interpretations,” including the desire for freedom and democracy.
</p><p>Much of the trial involved debate between professors drawing on a range of topics, including ancient Chinese history, the US civil rights movement and Malcolm X, to ascertain whether the “Liberate Hong Kong” slogan is subversive.
</p><p>Two expert witnesses called by the defense to analyze the slogan’s meaning, drawing upon sources including an examination of more than 2 million online posts, found “no substantial link” between the slogan and Hong Kong independence, Grossman said.
</p><p>However, Chau challenged that, saying this “empirical data analysis is irrelevant and not reliable,” and could not assist the court in understanding the meaning of the slogan.
</p><p>The defense argued that Tong had not undertaken a terrorist act with his motorcycle.
</p><p>A shield allegedly thrown by a police officer as he rode by could have been a reason for the “accident or a collision” with the officers, Grossman said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='d'>Beijing maintains Washington hack claims ‘fabricated’</h3><p>China yesterday said that the US had “fabricated” allegations it carried out a massive Microsoft hack, countering that Washington was the “world champion” of cyberattacks, while raging at the US’ allies for signing up to a rare joint statement of condemnation.
</p><p>The US on Monday accused Beijing of carrying out a March cyberattack on Microsoft Exchange, a top e-mail server for corporations around the world, and charged four Chinese over the “malicious” hack.
</p><p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken said the attack was part of a pattern of irresponsible, disruptive and destabilizing behavior in cyberspace.
</p><p>Photo: AFP</p><p>The Chinese Ministry of State Security has fostered an ecosystem of criminal contract hackers who carry out both state-sponsored activities and cybercrime for their own financial gain, Blinken said in a statement.
</p><p>In a simultaneous announcement, the US Department of Justice said that four Chinese had been charged with hacking the computers of dozens of companies, universities and government bodies in the US and abroad between 2011 and 2018.
</p><p>US President Joe Biden told reporters that Washington was still completing an investigation before taking any countermeasures, and drew parallels with the murky, but prolific cybercrimes attributed by Western officials to Russia.
</p><p>“The Chinese government, not unlike the Russian government, is not doing this themselves, but are protecting those who are doing it, and maybe even accommodating them being able to do it,” Biden told reporters.
</p><p>In an effort to put the diplomatic squeeze on Beijing, the US coordinated its statement with its allies — the EU, the UK, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan and NATO.
</p><p>China hit back, calling the allegations of a Beijing-supported cyberattack campaign “fabricated.”
</p><p>“The US has mustered its allies to carry out unreasonable criticisms against China on the issue of cybersecurity,” Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman Zhao Lijian (趙立堅) told reporters in Beijing. “This move is fabricated out of nothing.”
</p><p>Earlier, China’s diplomatic missions around the world rattled out rebuttals, as Beijing made its own coordinated defense.
</p><p>The Chinese embassy in New Zealand called the allegations “totally groundless and irresponsible,” while the embassy in Australia accused Canberra of “parroting the rhetoric of the US.”
</p><p>Biden has ramped up pressure on China, seeing the rising Asian power’s increasingly assertive moves at home and abroad as the main long-term threat to the US.
</p><p>Allies backed up the castigation of China, with British Secretary of State for Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Affairs Dominic Raab describing the cyberattack as “reckless.”
</p><p>NATO offered “solidarity” over the Microsoft hacking without directly assigning blame.
</p><p>US Department of State spokesman Ned Price said it was the first time that NATO has condemned cyberactivity from China.
</p><p>“We know we’ll be stronger, we know we’ll be more effective when we act collectively,” Price said, adding that the US was not ruling out further action.
</p><p>The Microsoft hack, which exploited flaws in the Microsoft Exchange service, affected at least 30,000 US organizations, including local governments, as well as organizations worldwide.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><hr class='rounded'><br><h3 id='n'>COVID-19: CECC reports 18 local infections</h3><p>The Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) yesterday reported 18 locally transmitted COVID-19 infections and four deaths.
</p><p>The most local infections were reported in Taipei, with seven cases, followed by New Taipei City (six), Keelung (three) and Taoyuan (two), said Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the center.
</p><p>Nine cases tested positive during isolation or upon ending it, Chen said, adding that the infection sources of 13 cases have been identified, while contact tracing continues to clarify the infection sources of the other five.
</p><p>Photo courtesy of the CECC</p><p>“The local infections reported recently have remained mostly in northern Taiwan, but while daily case counts have been relatively low, contact tracing needs to be more comprehensive,” Chen said. “Given the recent trend, the COVID-19 situation will be brought under control.”
</p><p>Most of the recent cases have been in Taipei and New Taipei City, with only sporadic cases in other cities and counties that need to have infection sources determined, while cluster infections in the past two weeks have been mainly within households, he said.
</p><p>There has been a rise in cases among younger people recently, so the center has asked local governments to expand the age range of key targets for COVID-19 prevention, while watching for community spread and enhancing medical capacity, he said.
</p><p>The CECC agreed to a suggestion by local governments that people who have spent 10 days in isolation following a positive test and no longer have symptoms, but who return a cycle threshold value (CT value) lower than 30 from a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, be ordered to continue isolation in an enhanced centralized quarantine facility or enhanced quarantine hotel, Chen said.
</p><p>As for people who complete home isolation or quarantine and have a CT value higher than 30, they are to be released from isolation after two such test results, he said.
</p><p>The CECC this week is to discuss with local governments preparations for a possible lowering next week of a nationwide level 3 COVID-19 alert, which is likely given the current situation, Chen said.
</p><p>Bringing the daily confirmed cases back to zero is almost impossible so soon after community spread, he said, adding that the center is trying to strike a balance between bringing COVID-19 under control and avoiding “pandemic fatigue.”
</p><p>As the virus situation is being brought under control, guidelines have been issued for venues and businesses to allow everyone to understand preventive and response measures, so they can act promptly if another outbreak occurs, he said.
</p><p>The CECC also reported six imported cases and four deaths.
</p><p>The imported cases were arrivals from Indonesia, Myanmar and the US, it said.
</p><p>Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Philip Lo (羅一鈞), deputy chief of the CECC’s medical response division, said that among 14,353 confirmed cases reported since April 20, 2,821 people, or 19.7 percent, were diagnosed with severe pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).
</p><p>Among 4,852 confirmed cases who are 60 or older, 1,884, or 38.8 percent, were diagnosed with severe pneumonia or ARDS, Lo said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='e'>COVID-19: Jab dates to be rescheduled if typhoon day announced</h3><p>People who have booked an appointment to be vaccinated against COVID-19, but are unable to get the jab if a typhoon day is announced, would be able to book a new appointment the following week, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) said yesterday.
</p><p>More than 8.86 million people in the sixth, eighth, ninth and 10th priority groups for vaccination, as well as people aged 18 to 49, had registered to get vaccinated on the national online COVID-19 vaccination booking system as of 12pm on Monday, the deadline for the latest round of vaccinations.
</p><p>However, two typhoons have formed near Taiwan and are likely to bring heavy rain and strong winds to the nation over the next few days.
</p><p>Vaccination locations would be closed if a local government suspends work due to a typhoon, said Minister of Health and Welfare Chen Shih-chung (陳時中), who heads the CECC.
</p><p>He said that 1,529,148 people yesterday had been sent a text message informing them that they were eligible to book an appointment.
</p><p>As of 1pm, 752,610 people, or 49.22 percent, had booked a time, he said.
</p><p>People who book an appointment, but do not get vaccinated due to a typhoon day would automatically be eligible for the next round of vaccinations and would receive a new text message, Chen added.
</p><p>Asked whether COVID-19 restrictions would be eased if a typhoon makes landfall, Chen said that people should wear a mask unless an emergency such as a flood arises, when “of course protecting life and personal safety is the most important matter.”
</p><p>Reporters asked at the CECC’s daily news conference in Taipei why some young people had received a text message and successfully booked an appointment when they did not have a disease that would put them in the ninth priority group.
</p><p>Centers for Disease Control Deputy Director-General Chuang Jen-hsiang (莊人祥), the CECC’s spokesman, said that such people might have been diagnosed with a condition listed as a high-risk disease in the past year, but have forgotten about it.
</p><p>The CECC would discuss with Minister Without Portfolio Audrey Tang (唐鳳), who designed the booking system, to determine whether anything is wrong with it, Chen said.
</p><p>Chen urged people in the first to third priority groups, as well as pregnant women, who have received a first dose of the Moderna vaccine to book an appointment for the second dose as soon as possible.
</p><p>As of Monday, 5,419,988 vaccines had been administered in Taiwan, coverage of 22.48 percent, CECC data showed.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='e'>Reopening of dementia centers discussed</h3><p>Dementia centers, which have been closed since a nationwide level 3 COVID-19 alert began in May, might conditionally reopen soon, with specifics to be announced next week, the Ministry of Health and Welfare said yesterday.
</p><p>While other care centers restarted operations last week, dementia centers were not included due to concern over their ability to adhere to pandemic guidelines, the ministry said.
</p><p>More than 7,000 people with minor symptoms of dementia receive care at 508 public centers nationwide, which were established through the government’s Long-term Care Service Program 2.0.
</p><p>The centers provide cognitive exercises, arrange group meals and help those they serve to participate in the community, among other services.
</p><p>As they are in a variety of different facilities, such as medical institutions, community centers and churches, their sizes and contact with other groups varies widely, the ministry said.
</p><p>This is different from other care centers, which are open on the condition that they serve a set number of people under strict conditions, such as having at least 6.6m2 of space per attendee, it said.
</p><p>As people with dementia might be less able to follow COVID-19 protocols, dementia centers would only be reopened after carefully weighing the benefits against the risk of viral transmission, the ministry said.
</p><p>Long-term Care Services Division Deputy Director Chou Tao-chun (周道君) told reporters that dementia centers must be evaluated separately from other types of care centers.
</p><p>Dementia centers are often in shared spaces that are not big enough to maintain social distancing, Chou said, adding that this requires further discussion to determine intake eligibility, as the centers would not be able to serve as many people.
</p><p>New operating guidelines for dementia centers are likely to be announced next week, after which they would be sent a checklist to evaluate standards such as vaccination coverage and available space, he said.
</p><p>Local governments would be responsible for inspecting centers as they see fit, he said.
</p><p>Asked whether the centers could meet standards of care set in the Long-Term Care Services Act (長期照顧服務法) given the restrictions, Chou said that local governments are encouraged to develop dementia centers into formal care centers, which could increase their capacity from 15 to 60 people per hour.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='D'>Shipment of plastic lunchboxes seized at border by FDA</h3><p>A shipment of plastic lunchbox sets was seized at the border because they failed an evaporation residue test, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said yesterday.
</p><p>The shipment of 50 Kakao Friends lunchbox sets from China was seized after plastic chopsticks and spoons in the sets were found to contain 100 parts per million (ppm) and 122 ppm of residue respectively after being soaked in 4 percent acetic acid solution for 30 minutes, the FDA said.
</p><p>The maximum residue level allowed is 30ppm.
</p><p>Photo courtesy of the FDA via CNA</p><p>FDA Northern Center head Chen Ching-yu (陳慶裕) said that the tests are conducted on packaging, containers or utensils containing plastic that come into direct contact with food to check whether the plastic might migrate into food after contact with acid.
</p><p>The FDA will increase the frequency with which it inspects goods imported by the company that shipped in lunchboxes, Chen said.
</p><p>The lunchboxes were among eight items in the FDA’s weekly report on imported shipments confiscated for food safety breaches.
</p><p>Other items included apples from Chile, chili powder from Vietnam and Romaine lettuce from the US for containing pesticides above permitted levels.
</p><p>A shipment of boneless beef from Honduras was found to contain excessive levels of an adrenergic agonist called zilpaterol, while a shipment of corn flour from India was seized for containing excessive levels of aflatoxins, which are commonly found in improperly stored commodities, the FDA said.
</p><p>The seized products were either returned to their country of origin or destroyed, it said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='f'>Greenpeace urges government action on coral reefs</h3><p>Coral reefs around Taiwan are still under threat, Greenpeace said yesterday, urging the government to act more aggressively on the matter.
</p><p>Greenpeace last year launched a project to document changes to reefs.
</p><p>Data compiled over the past six months showed that 60 percent of the coral reefs being monitored in Taiwan are dying due to continuous bleaching, as was observed last summer, project director Chiu Tsung-jung (邱聰榮) said.
</p><p>Photo courtesy of Greenpeace Taiwan via CNA</p><p>Bleaching last year, which was the worst since Taiwan began keeping records in the 1980s, was due to global warming and a lack of typhoons, Chiu said.
</p><p>The reefs being monitored seem not to have recovered from last year and are covered in algae, which indicates death, he said.
</p><p>The reefs are in areas where the worst bleaching occurred last year, including Siaoliouciou Island (小琉球) and the Kenting (墾丁) area in Pingtung County, and Taitung County’s Green Island (綠島).
</p><p>The optimal temperature for coral growth is 20°C to 28°C, while bleaching occurs below 18°C or above 30°C, experts say.
</p><p>The Greenpeace project found that the temperatures of the water in the monitored areas was 30°C to 31°C in general, Chiu said.
</p><p>The government must set stricter carbon reduction targets, which will help control ocean temperatures and preserve corals reefs, he said.
</p><p>Extensive research on Taiwan’s coral reefs will also be required to devise a more effective protection plan, Chiu said.
</p><p>Fan Tung-yung (樊同雲), a coral reef researcher at the National Museum of Marine Biology and Aquarium, said that the central and local governments must take aggressive action to stop the bleaching.
</p><p>“There should be more marine conservation areas, particularly near Siaoliouciou Island,” Fan said.
</p><p>Hsu Chia-chuan (許家銓), a diving coach on Green Island who participated in the reef monitoring program, said he was saddened by the condition of Taiwan’s reefs.
</p><p>“I was in tears when I saw the bleached coral reefs,” Hsu said. “I felt so helpless.”
</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that coral reefs worldwide are likely to decline by 70 to 90 percent if the global average surface temperature increases by 1.5°C above pre-industrial times, and they would all be lost if it rises by 2°C.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='o'>Foreign students need relief: union</h3><p>The Taiwan Higher Education Union yesterday urged the government to extend eligibility for the education and labor ministries’ COVID-19 relief programs to foreign students. 
</p><p>In anticipation of possible financial difficulties that university and college students could face amid the COVID-19 pandemic, the Ministry of Education has launched a relief scheme as part of the Executive Yuan’s “Relief 4.0” package, the union said in a statement.
</p><p>Under the plan, students or members of their family who have been recognized by universities as having been financially affected by the pandemic can receive subsidies from the ministry through the institutions, including emergency student grants and rent subsidies for off-campus housing, it said. 
</p><p>The Ministry of Labor has also offered a NT$10,000 subsidy to eligible part-time workers, many of whom are students with financial difficulties, the union said.
</p><p>However, the relief programs are limited to Taiwanese students, it said.
</p><p>Only Taiwanese citizens with a household registration may apply to the Ministry of Education’s relief program, while applicants to the Ministry of Labor’s subsidy for part-time workers must fulfill employment insurance requirements, but under the Employment Insurance Act (就業保險法), only Taiwanese citizens and people who have marriage-based residency are insured, the union said. 
</p><p>As a result, many foreign students at Taiwan’s universities and colleges who have been living in the nation for a long time and have been affected by a local COVID-19 outbreak have been unable to apply for assistance, it said.
</p><p>University lecturers have received calls for help from foreign students struggling because of the pandemic, the union said. 
</p><p>One lecturer told the union that they last week received a message from a Vietnamese student saying that she had planned on working part-time this summer to save money for her living expenses next semester, but she has been unable to find work due to the COVID-19 outbreak, the union said.
</p><p>Many countries have provided international students with the same kind of assistance they offer to local students — or even special assistance — since the pandemic began, it said.
</p><p>When planning its relief policy, the government should consider everyone living in Taiwan who is facing difficulties due to the outbreak, the union said.
</p><p>Like Taiwanese citizens, foreign migrant workers and students also live in this country and are indispensable to society, it said. 
</p><p>Only by including everyone living in Taiwan in the government’s relief policy would the true meaning of the phrase “one island, one life” be realized, it said, referring to a slogan frequently used to promote COVID-19 prevention efforts in the nation.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='e'>KMT urges plan for new semester</h3><p>The Ministry of Education should hold discussions and prepare for a possible reopening of schools in September, Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) Legislator Lin Yi-hua (林奕華) said yesterday.

</p><p>Since May 19, schools at all levels have been ordered to suspend in-person instruction as part of a nationwide level 3 COVID-19 alert.

</p><p>With the new academic year approaching, the ministry still appears to be fixed on the question of relief, Lin said. 
</p><p>“No one is discussing whether schools will open next semester,” she added.
</p><p>Due to the lack of discussion, not enough preparations have been made for a return to school, she said. 
</p><p>One of the most fundamental issues with such a plan is that the COVID-19 vaccine coverage rate in the nation is not high enough, Lin said.
</p><p>Even if schools were to reopen, multiple plans would be needed to respond to different situations that could occur, she said.
</p><p>Furthermore, as the size of each school building is different, a single plan should not be applied to all schools across the nation, she said.
</p><p>While the hope is that schools would reopen in September, as long as vaccination rates remain lower than desired, the ministry must consider different possibilities and devise plans, she said. 
</p><p>The ministry should also involve teachers and parents in discussions of its plans, she added.
</p><p>Lo Hui-chun (羅惠群), vice chairman of the Taiwan Counseling Psychologist Union, spoke of the importance of public mental health awareness and called on people to place greater importance on the issue.
</p><p>During the COVID-19 outbreak, the Ministry of Education could consider hiring more educators and counselors, he said.
</p><p>Many parents, either out of concern for their children’s studies or because they cannot look after their children due to work, look forward to the resumption of in-person instruction, said Yang Yi-feng (楊益風), chairman of a national educators’ union. 
</p><p>While teachers also look forward to teaching in person again, many of them also believe that schools are not ready to reopen, he said.

</p><p>The Taroko Express No. 408 on April 2 derailed in the Cingshuei Tunnel (清水隧道) after slamming into a crane truck that had slid onto the tracks, killing 49 people and injuring 245. 
</p><p>The crane truck was owned by a contractor hired by the TRA for  construction to stabilize slopes along the railway line.
</p><p>While the Taiwan Transportation Safety Board is in charge of investigating the causes of the crash, the ministry investigated the TRA for officials who should be held accountable.  The ministry published its report on Sunday.
</p><p>The administrative investigation should have probed United Geotech Inc and whether it had fulfilled its responsibility of overseeing construction work based on its contract with the TRA, NPP caucus whip Chiu Hsien-chih (邱顯智) said.
</p><p>However, the TRA has said that United Geotech participated in the investigation as well, he said.
</p><p>“What role did Geotech play in the investigation? Was it both the player and referee? The railway agency should offer a clear explanation to the public,” he said.
</p><p>The report points to problems with the contractor, but does not mention any mistakes by the TRA, Chiu said, adding that this shows that the railway agency avoided the truth and has no intention of improving railway safety. 
</p><p>NPP deputy caucus whip Chen Jiau-hua (陳椒華) said the incident exposed the TRA’s “business as usual” attitude: blaming ground-level workers whenever accidents happen and having no intention of pursuing meaningful reform. 
</p><p>However, the report shows that a ministry task force had found in multiple on-site inspections that construction sites 2m above the railway track lacked guard rails, Chen said, but the TRA’s construction crew in Hualien left the issue unresolved. 
</p><p>Following the derailment of a Puyuma Express train in 2018, the Executive Yuan conducted a comprehensive review of the TRA’s operations and listed 144 issues that had to be addressed, Chen said.
</p><p>One of the issues was to enhance safety along railway sections where there is ongoing construction nearby, but the ministry on March 16 last year removed the item from a list of closely monitored issues, Chen said. 
</p><p>If the ministry had regularly checked the TRA’s progress in addressing these issues, the Taroko Express crash would not have occurred, she said. 
</p><p>“After the Taroko Express incident, the TRA’s construction division chief in Hualien was given a major demerit. However, then-TRA deputy director general Du Wei (杜微) was promoted to director rather than being demoted. The Railway Bureau, which oversees the TRA’s operations, was not blamed for that incident either,” she said. 
</p><p>“This shows that senior officials at the ministry, the Railway Bureau and the TRA neither took full responsibility for what happened nor did they review root causes of the incident,” she added. 
</p><p>Wang Wei-chun (王薇君), who represents family members of people who died in the Taroko Express derailment, said that although the report was compiled on May 21, the families found out about it through media reports. 
</p><p>The ministry should have notified the deceased’s next of kin about the report first, she said.
</p><p>“To them [ministry officials], 49 is nothing but a number,” she said. 
</p><p>On Monday, some relatives of the victims went to the ministry to submit a petition, but they were blocked by police, Wang said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='t'>Taiwan donates 150,000 masks to Brazilian state</h3><p>Taiwan has donated 150,000 masks to Goias State in central Brazil to help residents there fight the COVID-19 pandemic. 
</p><p>Representative to Brazil Chang Tsung-che (張崇哲) presented the donation to Goias Governor Ronaldo Caiado’s wife, Gracinha Caiado, at a ceremony on Friday. The ceremony was also attended by Goias Deputy Governor Lincoln Tejota and representatives from local volunteer organizations.

</p><p>Chang expressed the hope that the donation can help local residents mitigate a COVID-19 outbreak and return to their normal lives as soon as possible. 
</p><p>Taiwan has donated 54 million masks to more than 80 countries, including Brazil, since early last year, Chang said. 
</p><p>Gracinha Caiado expressed her thanks and said the masks would be distributed to institutions and organizations involved in the state’s COVID-19 response.

</p><p>Businesses in the sector have been hit particularly hard since May, when the government issued a nationwide level 3 COVID-19 alert, Lai told an online news conference with industry and consumer representatives. 
</p><p>The government should expand the scope eligibility for the funds, devise measures for gradually relaxing pandemic restrictions and extend the payment period for government loans, she said. 
</p><p>Photo: CNA</p><p>Pandemic restrictions should also be clearly explained to businesses and the public as restrictions are eased, she added. 
</p><p>“Since last year there have been more than 40 tourism businesses that have gone under. This has put a lot of people out of work,” she said. “Ministry of Labor statistics show that at least 31,000 people have been furloughed — mostly in the hospitality and tourism industries.”
</p><p>While NT$5 billion (US$178.19 million) has been budgeted for the industries targeted by the government’s latest relief program, only about 48 percent of that has been distributed to businesses, she said. 
</p><p>“This year things have gotten even worse. Half of the 40,000 people employed in the tourism industry have been laid off,” Travel Quality Assurance Association spokesman Lee Chi-yueh (李奇嶽) said. 
</p><p>“The UK and France have provided relief to 80 percent of tourism businesses, but we have only helped less than 50 percent of those businesses,” he said. 
</p><p>The government should also provide health and unemployment insurance to furloughed workers in the sector, he added. 
</p><p>“The government should train new talent for the industry and try to reinvigorate it before lifting restrictions,” he said. 
</p><p>Taipei Hotel Association director Wei Chien-hua (韋建華) said he hopes the government will devise a plan to stimulate post-pandemic employment in the tourism industry. 
</p><p>The government should budget NT$2 trillion over the next five years to subsidize salaries in the sector, he said. 
</p><p>“The industry hires young people, and if those young people do not have employment, they will not have money to spend — which will have an economic impact,” he said. 
</p><p>Great River Queen cruise ship manager Lin Shu-fu (林書賦) said that cruise ship and recreational boating businesses have had to fully stop their operations, but are ineligible for relief funds. 
</p><p>Businesses in the sector could survive if the government offered loans and lower interest rates, he said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='t'>Passage of US bill ‘shows anti-China sentiment’</h3><p>US lawmakers’ passage of a bill that aims to ensure the country’s leadership in the Indo-Pacific region shows growing anti-China sentiment in the US Congress, a researcher said on Friday.
</p><p>The US House Foreign Affairs Committee on Thursday passed the Ensuring American Global Leadership and Engagement Act (EAGLE Act), which contains several provisions regarding the US’ diplomatic and economic ties with Taiwan. 
</p><p>“There is this anti-China sentiment there, which is driving members of the US Congress to explore every type of option to strengthen ties with Taiwan,” said Arthur Ding (丁樹範), professor emeritus in National Chengchi University’s Graduate Institute of East Asia Studies. 
</p><p>Photo: Chien Jung-fong, Taipei Times</p><p>The act calls for an expansion of the US-Taiwan trade relationship, urges action to promote Taiwan’s participation in international organizations and calls for starting negotiations on renaming Taiwan’s representative office in the US to the “Taiwan Representative Office in the United States.” 
</p><p>The Taiwan International Solidarity Act — which was incorporated into the EAGLE Act — states that the UN’s recognition of the People’s Republic of China as the sole representative of China makes no determinations about Taiwan’s sovereignty or its representation at the UN. 
</p><p>“The renaming of Taiwan’s representative office in the US in particular must be addressed, because the current name — the Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office — does not sound political in nature,” Ding said. “The current name reduces Taiwan’s status to that of Hong Kong.”
</p><p>Former minister of foreign affairs Chen Chien-jen (程建人) said the bill shows that US-China relations have hit a new low. 
</p><p>“However, this has also resulted in many Taiwan-friendly voices within the US Congress to emerge,” he said.
</p><p>The US recognizes China’s rise as a challenge and threat to its interests, which provided the impetus for creating the EAGLE Act, he said, adding that any law aimed at China would unavoidably touch upon Taiwan. 
</p><p>“However, things like renaming the representative office are sensitive subjects, and it remains to be seen whether the US administration will act upon the clauses of this act,” he said. 
</p><p>Nevertheless, support for Taiwan at different levels of the US government and society is a welcome sight, he said. 
</p><p>The EAGLE Act needs to be reviewed by the full House before being put to a vote in both chambers of Congress and being signed into law by the US president.
</p><p>Additional reporting by CNA</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='t'>KMT allowed to transfer assets to local governments</h3><p>The Ill-gotten Party Assets Settlement Committee on Tuesday last week approved a request by the Chinese Nationalist Party (KMT) to donate two properties and a plot of land to local governments.
</p><p>The assets are in Taitung County’s Beinan Township (卑南), Taitung City and Hualien City. 
</p><p>The request is in line with an addendum to Article 9 of the Act Governing the Handling of Ill-gotten Properties by Political Parties and Their Affiliate Organizations (政黨及其附隨組織不當取得財產處理條例), the committee said.
</p><p>According to the article, “the presumed ill-gotten party assets as prescribed in the preceding Paragraph 1 of Article 5 are prohibited from being transferred or disposed of from the date of promulgation of this act.” 
</p><p>However, the limitation does not apply “when it is necessary to perform legal duties or other justifiable reasons,” the article says.
</p><p>All three assets are on state-owned land. The property in Taitung City was obtained in August 1967 and the one in Hualien City was acquired in 1982.
</p><p>The KMT’s claim to the Beinan plot, which covers 22 ping (72.7m2), is more convoluted.
</p><p>Originally appearing in records as state-owned land in 1954, it was re-registered as private property in 1968 and changed hands twice afterward, before its ownership was transferred to a veteran, surnamed Lu (呂).
</p><p>The KMT “inherited” the plot from Lu, and while it tried to liquidate the land last year, its attempts to sell it fell through, the party said.
</p><p>Committee officials yesterday said that a road passes through the plot, which is the main reason why attempts to sell it failed.
</p><p>The government may incorporate into local road and traffic planning any road that is used by at least two households and that has been in use for at least 10 years, and the landowner may not forbid them from using the road, the committee said.</p><br><a href='#toc'>Back</a><br><h3 id='r'>Small return</h3><p>Kinmen County Commissioner Yang Cheng-wu, third right, yesterday presents a model ambulance to Wu Chang-shou and his wife, Lin Hsiu-chin, second and third left.
