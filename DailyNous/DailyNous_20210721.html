Read related work to see what others have said; stew on an idea for a week or a month or a year. Then write it up. Send it off. Desk reject. Stew some more. Revise and resubmit. Stew some more. Accepted. Submit the proofs. Repeat.</p><p>That’s a tried and true model of doing philosophy. And it is a model that we follow a lot of the time. We’re fans of lonely-armchair methodology, and we see no reason to abandon it.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.pdcnet.org/teachphil/content/teachphil_2021_0044_0002_0187_0206" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent article</a> in <em>Teaching Philosophy</em>, however, we argue this isn’t the only way to do philosophy well. In fact, we suspect there are myriad ways of doing philosophy well. We focus on one: philosophy labs.</p><p>Philosophy labs are modeled on labs in STEM fields. No, philosophy labs typically won’t need a budget for beakers or Bunsen burners. Rather, philosophy labs follow the model provided by STEM labs in bringing together researchers at various stages of development—faculty, graduate students, and undergraduate students—to work collaboratively on professional-level projects. Philosophy labs are not merely independent studies or reading groups or research assistantships. They are instead research teams that include students and aim at professional goals: publications, fellowships, grant support, etc. Experimental philosophers have been using a lab-based model for years. We believe it is more broadly applicable within the discipline.</p><p>In a <a href="https://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2021/07/philosophy-labs.html">previous post at </a><a href="https://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2021/07/philosophy-labs.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Imperfect Cognition</em></a><a href="https://imperfectcognitions.blogspot.com/2021/07/philosophy-labs.html">s</a> and in our article at <em>Teaching Philosophy</em>, we argued in favor of philosophy labs and explored the model using the framework provided by Positive Interdependence Theory. Here, we take a different tack, and provide concrete recommendations for setting up and operating a philosophy lab, and some reasons you might want to do so.</p><p><strong>Prep Work</strong></p><p>Setting up a philosophy lab doesn’t rival the complexity of setting up a STEM lab: no need to purchase $100K of equipment or wrangle with facilities administrators to secure extra space on campus. Still, some initial leg work is necessary. Here are some steps we recommend:</p><p><strong>How to Operate a Lab</strong></p><p><strong>Reasons to Set Up a Lab</strong></p><p>Should we completely ditch lonely-armchair methodology in favor of a more collaborative research? Easy answer: no. Moreover, philosophy labs are not for everyone. We believe, however, that the model we have described provides a valuable model for philosophical research and pedagogy, and would welcome broader implementation of it in the field.</p><p style="text-align: right;">[top image: Aleksandr Rodchenko, “Spatial Construction No. 12”]

Among them were a few dozen philosophers from a variety of schools: logical empiricists, critical theorists, and phenomenologists. Especially the first group would have a tremendous impact on American philosophy. Whereas the local intellectual climate had been dictated by American traditions like pragmatism, U.S. philosophers soon began to advance views that were heavily indebted to the empiricists.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Historians have extensively reconstructed the fate of the exiled empiricists. Still, little attention has been paid to the American context in which their movement came to full bloom. This is surprising, since any account of the empiricists’ success requires an explanation of why the Americans were so receptive to their views. To what extent did developments in American philosophy pave the way for logical empiricism? And why was the American community more receptive to empiricism than to critical theory or phenomenology? This project shifts the perspective from the refugees to the local philosophical climate by 1) quantitatively analyzing thousands of American journal publications and 2) qualitatively examining the archives of dozens of key American philosophers and institutions.</em></p><p>You can learn about the other grant winners <a href="https://www.nwo.nl/en/news/78-researchers-receive-nwo-vidi-grant-worth-800000-euros" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://dailynous.com/linkout/38942" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-38940 aligncenter" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-keep-an-open-mind-bett-princeton-university-press.gif" width="400"/></a></p><p>Gefeliciteerd Sander / congrats!<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425233"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425233', 'c625676634', '39120');">Report</a></span></p><p>Gefeliciteerd Sander / congrats!</p><p>I don't want to take away from Kernion, but this narrative does a severe disservice to Joanna Ong.

He notes that he had heard several concerns about Searle’s behavior, but that the university did not appear to be taking such concerns seriously:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>For years, grad students have voiced concerns about Searle through official channels, hoping for some official response. While there’s been no publicy-announced sanctions or anything like that, it has been suggested to us that complaints about Searle have lead to…something. Searle is now officially retired but he continues to teach a very large lecture course, give seminars, and the university just this month officially opened the John Searle Center for</em><br/>
<em>Social Ontology…</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>So here’s my motivation for reaching out to you. It’s clear to me that the university won’t ever voluntarily take away the privileges it grants Searle in terms of institutional support and the opportunity to teach undergraduates. It’s equally clear to me that the university won’t, without outside pressure, make public their own investigations into Searle’s behavior.</em></p><p><em>Buzzfeed </em><a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/famous-philosophy-professor-accused-sexual-harassment" rel="noopener" target="_blank">reported</a> on the <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/katiejmbaker/john-searle-complaints-uc-berkeley" rel="noopener" target="_blank">story</a>, and eventually, after finding Searle in violation of the Berkeley’s sexual harassment policies, the university <a href="https://dailynous.com/2019/06/21/searle-found-violated-sexual-harassment-policies/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">removed his emeritus status</a>.</p><p>In a post at his site, Dr. Kernion recounts what it was like to blow the whistle on Searle, and what Berkeley’s <a href="https://philosophy.berkeley.edu/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Department of Philosophy</a> was doing at the time. It reveals a lack (probably a fairly common lack) of preparation for how to deal with this kind of situation.</p><p>After the the <em>Buzzfeed </em>story broke, the graduate students in the department requested a meeting with faculty:</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>But at that meeting, and at subsequent meetings, our questions went largely unanswered. Instead, in prepared remarks, our department chair focused on: 1) how the faculty never violated university policies requiring them to report complaints of sexual harassment, and 2) how confidentiality policies limited how much additional information they were allowed to share.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This was inadequate.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>That they themselves didn’t violate university policies was beside the point. What I took the grad students to be asking for was some kind of reassurance that the faculty were committed to acting in a morally responsible way–that they took their obligations as leaders of our community seriously. But no such reassurance was provided. They instead wanted to shift focus from ethical responsibilities to employment responsibilities.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>And when I pressed the faculty, in that meeting, to give a more precise characterization of what they were/weren’t allowed to share under the university’s confidentiality policies, they weren’t able to give me a clear answer.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I told them that, as I understood the policy–after carefully reading it–it required us to not disclose information communicated to us ‘from above’ (i.e. information collected by the university and then provided to an employee, so that they could do their job), but it did not preclude us from swapping stories and sharing our own first-person knowledge of Searle’s misconduct. The key idea being: it seemed to me like we had been misled into thinking we couldn’t talk about this stuff more openly.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>That the professors themselves didn’t seem to have a firm grip on the confidentiality policy was revealing to me: they’d never gotten as far in their own contemplation of how to respond to rumors of Searle’s misconduct as I did. I felt that I had to send that email to BuzzFeed, to uphold my responsibilities. I could only presume that they did not feel similarly.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>So I found the faculty’s position hard to understand. Weren’t they afraid of damaging their relationship with the grad students? Did they not see how, in the absence of transparency, we’d jump to an unflattering-to-the-faculty interpretation of events? Why were they showing such deference to the administration? Did they not worry about how this lame response would hurt the department’s reputation? On narrow self-interest grounds, shouldn’t they have taken a different stance? What exactly were their motivations?</em></p><p>At the time, Dr. Kernion had only told a few close friends about his connection to the <em>Buzzfeed</em> investigative report, but he had been pushing for more information from the department about the matter.</p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>I was surprised when my efforts to push for more information were met with hostility. I was made to feel like some kind of weirdo, for thinking we needed to talk about what had happened and have more transparency. That faculty members thought I was being unreasonable angered me more than anything else.</em></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>This was disorienting. I had to update my understanding of ‘how the world works’. I started to find it difficult to develop and sustain trusting professional relationships. If academic philosophers passively accepted Searle’s abusive behavior, what else were they passively accepting?</em></p><p>You can read Dr. Kernion’s full post <a href="https://jacksonkernion.com/posts/I-Blew-The-Whistle-On-John-Searle" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><p style="text-align: right;">[Image: film still of “Tattooed Skeleton” by Suzanne Lacy]

I read them with fascination and was hooked for life. Together with my friend Joseph Raz, we established a philosophy reading group at school (in Haifa, Israel, where I lived from 1950-1960). So, with half a dozen friends we struggled with Plato and Aristotle, Berkeley and Spinoza. Our ignorance and blindness were partly compensated for by our curiosity and enthusiasm.</p><p><strong>How did your relationship to philosophy change over the course of your career, and has it changed again since retirement?</strong></p><p>I came to study philosophy as part of the Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE) school at Oxford (1960). I had no clear idea what exactly philosophy was. I was fascinated by philosophical questions, but fumbled around with the subject, learning a great deal, but with little if any understanding of what I was doing. This bewilderment continued throughout my undergraduate and graduate years, and indeed the early years of my life as a Fellow of St John’s College. It was only when I began to study Wittgenstein’s later philosophical works in 1968 that light began to dawn. I wrote my first book <em>Insight and Illusion: Wittgenstein on philosophy and the metaphysics of experience</em> (1972). It was successful, but as I gradually came to realise, riddled with serious misunderstandings. These were rectified in the second edition: <em>Insight and Illusion: themes in the philosophy of</em> <em>Wittgenstein</em> (1986; 3<sup>rd</sup> edition Anthem Press, 2021) in which I rewrote half the book. So it was only after more than ten years of struggle that I learnt from Wittgenstein what philosophy is, what the nature of a philosophical problem is, how to tackle philosophical questions, and what can be hoped for from philosophy. This gave quietus to all my doubts about what I was doing and about the value of philosophy.</p><p>This large battery of Wittgensteinian insights has informed all my work since then. My conception of philosophy was further deepened by Anthony Kenny and Bede Rundle with whom I enjoyed numerous discussions and from whose books I learnt more than I can say. I was also greatly influenced by G.H. von Wright (the greatest of Wittgenstein’s pupils), Norman Malcolm (another of Wittgenstein’s outstanding pupils), Gilbert Ryle, J.L. Austin, Peter Strawson, and Alan White. To be able to learn from such fine thinkers and to be privileged to stand on their shoulders and to try to further the common endeavor has been wonderful.</p><p>Six years before my retirement I was enticed into the conceptual and philosophical problems of cognitive neuroscience by a great Australian neuroscientist Maxwell Bennett. We wrote two large books together, <em>Philosophical Foundations of Neuroscience </em>( first edition 2003, second enlarged edition 2022) as well as numerous papers in neuroscientific journals. It has been a remarkable, fruitful, invaluable experience. Among other things, it broadened my conception of philosophy and of what philosophy can contribute to extra-philosophical subjects. Wittgenstein was inclined to think that philosophical problems arise ‘when language is idling’ and that its primary concern was to solve, resolve or dissolve philosophical problems. Scrutiny of the writings of past and present cognitive neuroscientists, guided by Max Bennett, showed me vividly that conceptual confusion and philosophical misconceptions can be, and are, rife in a science. I came to see that cognitive neuroscience is riddled with conceptual error and misunderstanding, and that these mistakes and misunderstandings are anything but trivial. They contribute to the design of futile experiments, to the misinterpretation of the results of experiments, to asking unintelligible questions and trying futilely to answer them, and, in neurology, to prescribing misguided treatments.</p><p>I am convinced that human thought in general is riddled with conceptual confusions, for example in moral and political reflection. I am similarly certain that many of the sciences are too, for example, the science of economics the prescriptions of which so often rule our lives seems to me to be calling out for philosophical critique. So too is the science of psychology.</p><p>A further way in which my views on philosophy have changed since my retirement has been a consequence of my main retirement project since 2006, the writing of a tetralogy on human nature (completed in 2021). The subjects dealt with in these four volumes range from such abstract notions of substance, causation, agency and explanation to good and evil, the meaning of life and the place of death in life. This made me realise with greater depth than before that philosophical investigation must engage with a significant part of our forms of thought and reasoning, with a large fragment of our conceptual scheme. Otherwise it is of little value to its author, and probably of little value to its readers. Minute work is indispensable to be sure, but only with an eye on its place in the larger network. The ultimate goal is always to obtain an overview of a larger whole.</p><p><strong>How do you motivate yourself to read and write philosophy?</strong></p><p>I am lucky enough not to need motivating. The great problems of philosophy fascinate me, and I think largely by writing (and talking). Although in my younger days I kept an eye on current journal publications, I now rarely read journals, but concentrate on the great masters of the past. Philosophy is not a science, and the latest journal articles are not expressions of the most advanced thought. One is not going to find anyone writing in the current journals who is remotely as deep and thoughtful as Plato and Aristotle or Kant and Wittgenstein. Of course, great thinkers made mistakes, but their mistakes are <em>great </em>mistakes and they are usually clearly articulated. It is from such mistakes that one can learn. As Paul Valèry remarked: ‘A mistake is a light, a great mistake – a sun’.</p><p><strong>Does philosophy have an objective? And is the objective of philosophy today different from the objective of philosophy in the past?</strong></p><p>The word ‘philosophy’ has meant many different things throughout the ages. After all, what we today call ‘physics’ was once part of philosophy, namely so called natural philosophy. It began to separate from philosophy only in the seventeenth century. Psychology broke away from philosophy only in the nineteenth century. It is only in the late twentieth century that formal logic began to separate from philosophy.</p><p>It is striking that when subjects spin off from philosophy and become independent sciences, they always leave a philosophical subject behind. The independence of physics spawned the philosophy of physics, the autonomy of psychology left both philosophy of mind and philosophy of psychology behind, and logic leaves the philosophy of logic in its wake.</p><p>The objective of philosophy is the solution, resolution, or dissolution of the problems of philosophy. It is Janus-faced. Negatively, its task is to expose and dissolve conceptual confusion and incoherence, both in the form of questions (e.g. Where does the brain think? What is the self?) and in the form of statements (e.g. ‘Mental images are representations’, ‘Human beings are just repositories for selfish genes’). Positively or constructively, its task is to provide an overview of a conceptual domain, to bring into view the complex relationships between a problematic or pivotal concept and the associated concepts within the conceptual network to which it belongs: to map out the logical geography of concepts that are the source of conceptual puzzlement. In the domains of morality, political thought and law the task of philosophy is again clarification of concepts, but further, the scrutiny of values, their relationships and justifications.</p><p><strong>All over the world conservative governments are cutting funding to the humanities and allocating funding to the sciences. What is behind this move?</strong></p><p>I can think of few more alarming developments in government educational policies. What lies behind such moves is obviously the desire to save money. That is superficial. A deeper consideration is the conviction that society exists for the sake of its economy, rather than the economy for the sake of society. We now talk of the economy as if it were a living agent with a welfare of its own, for we speak of things being good for the economy or bad for the economy. This is coupled with the view that all institutions are businesses or industries and to be judged by what are thought to be the criteria for judging the success of an industry. So the health services are industries (and patients are clients); theatre and opera are part of the entertainment industry (and the audience are customers); and universities are educational businesses – to be run by bureaucrats for the sake of turning out trained personnel to feed business, industry (properly speaking) and the bureaucracy.</p><p>This is dire. Universities are the repository of our culture. Their greatest role is to teach the most able of our youth their cultural heritage – the best that was discovered and created in the past, and to foster ideals of truth and pursuit of knowledge and understanding. (That is why there can be no political correctness at good universities.)</p><p>The study of the humanities, when properly taught, not only transmits our cultural heritage, it also teaches the next generation to think for themselves, to argue coherently, to engage in civilized debate, to learn critical habits of thought, not so much to answer questions, but to question questions. It is above all students of the humanities that become social critics, and every healthy society needs social critics.</p><p><strong>Can science answer many of the questions philosophy asks?</strong></p><p>No, science cannot answer any philosophical questions. The sciences are (very roughly) intellectual disciplines that pursue the discovery of empirical truths and, where possible, laws of nature in their several domains, and the construction of empirical theories that explain them.</p><p>The questions of philosophy are not empirical questions, but conceptual and axiological ones. Scientific truths are to be attained by the employment of our <em>conceptual network</em>, the conceptual scheme articulated in our language (including, of course, the technical language of a given science). But one should not confuse the catch with the net. Knots in the net need to be disentangled, but to disentangle a knot is not to catch a fish. Moreover, no number of fish can repair a net.</p><p><strong>How has the discipline of philosophy changed during your lifetime?</strong></p><p>It has become much more specialized, and with the specialization has come lack of depth. It has become ever more in awe of the achievements of science, and ever more desirous to emulate the sciences in whatever ways possible. But the proper task of philosophy is to be the conceptual critic of scientists, not to sing the Hallelujah chorus to them.</p><p>The style of writing has deteriorated – just pick up a copy of <em>Mind</em> from the 1950s and compare it with the latest issue of <em>Mind</em>. Spatterings of the predicate calculus all over the page are deemed necessary in order to appear precise and scientific, whereas all they usually do is to make their author look ridiculous: ‘There is an <em>x</em>, such that <em>x</em> is a human being …’ is not more precise than ‘Someone’!</p><p>Contemporary philosophy is, for the most part, propounded by -ists and made up of -isms. A philosopher has to be a card-carrying member of some party or other: a realist or anti-realist, an internalist or externalist, a reductionist or an emergentist. It is theory ridden, and its proponents must advance one -ism or another. But we are given very little idea of what would confirm or disconfirm a theory. It frequently invokes metaphysics without giving any clear idea of what is meant by metaphysics. It invokes possible worlds without reflecting seriously on what a possible world might be and what exactly it means to assert that there are any.</p><p>It labours under the illusion that philosophy is akin to science in being progressive, so that the articles in the last decade of journals incorporate the philosophical knowledge of the ages. Hence the point from which to start is from a survey of everything written on a chosen topic in the journals of the last decade or two. All this does is perpetuate the follies, prejudices and bigotry of the current generation.</p><p>I am very sorry to say that philosophy at present is in a state of grievous decline.</p><p><strong>What advice do you have for someone who wants to pursue a career in philosophy?</strong></p><p>Pursue such a career only if you are fascinated by the problems of philosophy, if you feel that clarifying and answering philosophical problems is worth spending your life on, if you find teaching the young fulfilling, and if you can face the prospect of working for forty years in relative solitude. Bear in mind that the profession is intensely competitive, that your survival will depend on writing publishable papers, whether you have anything to say or not. Bear in mind that you will be in the hands of a professional bureaucracy whose goals are not academic and whose concern is not to help you but to drive you.</p><p><strong>Apart from studying, what is it important for aspiring philosophers to spend their time on?</strong></p><p>It is important to be well read, to have read a wide range of what used to be thought of as the canon of western culture. It is also important to read widely in history, not only for its own sake, but also to understand the socio-historical context in which the great works of philosophy were written. One cannot understand much of ancient philosophers without knowing a reasonable amount of ancient history. One cannot understand early modern philosophy without familiarity with post-renaissance European history and history of science.</p><p>Apart from such educational qualifications, spend your time learning not to answer questions, but to question questions.</p><p><strong>What do you wish you knew about academic philosophy before starting your career?</strong></p><p>Perhaps that academic life is just as uncivilized as non-academic life, that the temptations of self-deception and intellectual dishonesty are at least as great as in other professions.</p><p><strong>Job prospects in academic philosophy are dire. What advice would you have for the philosopher who fears the financial precariousness of academia? </strong></p><p>Don’t become an academic.</p><p><strong>Many people, including myself, find it difficult to stomach the culture of smartness, argumentation, and hyperrationality present in philosophy departments. In what way has philosophy impacted your wellbeing, if at all?</strong></p><p>Philosophy has given me a deep sense of fulfilment. It has given me the understanding I craved and answered the questions that perturbed and disturbed me. I have tried to communicate this to others, in teaching and in writing, and that too has often been gratifying.</p><p><a href="https://dailynous.com/linkout/38942" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="wp-image-38940 aligncenter" height="200" loading="lazy" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/how-to-keep-an-open-mind-bett-princeton-university-press.gif" width="400"/></a></p><p>I took/attended PMS Hacker’s Wittgenstein lectures at Oxford.

Probably it would be more constructive to engage with these doubts rather than write them off unreflectively. Is philosophy doing well today? Seems like a fair question.

Of course academic philosophy might be in decline, but I didn’t see much of an argument to engage with (unlike the previous DN post you mention, which has argument).

Fairly, but not dogmatically, as is (by my lights) appropriate.

Same for Kant, and for Heidegger.  </p><p>But I just don’t get why people can’t just say, “I have my views on what we should be doing. But these views were arrived at by philosophical reflection, and it is not obvious that my views about what we should be doing are correct. So I’ll continue to work in the manner that my metaphilosophical views permit but I won’t be a jerk about it.”  <span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425202"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425202', '5b8e1f0313', '39084');">Report</a></span></p><p>You seem very confident in your view that folks shouldn’t be confident about their views.

But since I thought Hurka’s riff on Wittgenstein was so tangential *and* wrong, it deserves correction. Anyone who actually “looks [at] and sees” Wittgenstein’s text will clearly see him say one remark earlier: “I’m saying that these phenomena have no one thing in common<strong> in virtue of which we use the same word for all</strong>” (§65, emphasis added). This is very explicitly the theme of the following sections, including that on games (§66). (As we would now put it, he’s arguing that the justification for using (some) words/concepts can be particularist.)</p><p>I think he put in enough effort to make that (his actual) point, to which (1) Suit’s definition is no real counterexample, and (2) Hurka’s “half second, quarter second” quip is no more than baseless disrespect. Obviously, it takes longer than that to write the words! And Wittgenstein does rule out a good selection of the likeliest single-answer counterexamples (that we call <em>x </em>a game if and because it’s entertaining / competitive / an  exercise of skill against luck). I don’t know what Hurka had in mind by saying Wittgenstein’s “<span>supposed differences, e.g. between card games and board games, are utterly superficial,” since Wittgenstein never actually lays *those* out.

By this I do not mean that every participant was necessarily aware of this, but the semantics is encoded in the truth-tables that we teach our undergraduates.<br/>

Possible worlds is one such answer but carries with it significant baggage (how do we know the truth of such statements, etc).

I generally find philosophers surprisingly uncritical of their project(s) and methodology. There are some facts about philosophy only those outside of philosophy seem to take seriously, its lack (or at the very least, highly specific form of) progress, lack of established truths, no predictive ability, high degree of divergence of views about what is correct and which methods are correct/best, and its relative lack of specific domain.

But the lesson I take from Wittgenstein, which Hacker does not appear to take, is not to stop doing whatever kind of philosophy one finds interesting (or to convince others to stop), but to do one’s philosophy with a renewed and hopefully better understanding of what one is doing. </p><p>For example, Wittgenstein, in Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics, got after Russell and his attempt to formalize mathematics not because Wittgenstein found the attempt bankrupt or uninteresting or unhelpful. It was rather because Wittgenstein thought (and attempted to show) that Russell misunderstood the significance of the latter’s own project. From Wittgenstein’s point of view, there was a philosophically (and not a mathematically) consequential sense in which Russell did not know what he was up to: Russell was missing the real significance of his work.</p><p>This is an illustration of the more general tack.

In this guest post<a href="https://dailynous.com/about/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">*</a>, <a href="https://meetgreen.com/about-meetgreen/team/eric-wallinger/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eric Wallinger</a>, Director of Sustainability at Meet Green, shares some climate-oriented strategies for in-person event-planning that conference planners should consider taking into account.</p><p>Meetings, conventions, and events are an expression of an organization’s values. In ways both large and small, they speak volumes about an organization in either its physical or digital manifestation. At their core, sustainability efforts are often connected to either optimizing efficiency of our resources such as energy and water, reducing waste, and enhancing the life cycles of our event materials.</p><p><strong>Starting Early</strong></p><p>To help achieve a more sustainable conference, it is essential to <strong>start early in the process</strong>, ideally at the time of site selection or contracting, enrolling the full spectrum of stakeholders in your conversations, and ensuring your team has some mechanism for accountability, such as a standing Green Team meeting, a sustainability policy, or defined indicators in place to help drive these initiatives forward. This might sound simple, but it is one of the most important things you can do to ensure sustainability planning success. This article helps identify key issues that impact the sustainability of an event and strategies your team can take to help mitigate your event’s environmental footprint.</p><p><strong>Landfill Waste</strong></p><p>Reducing landfill waste is a major challenge for any event, and very often event organizers and venues face the difficult question of where to start. In our experience, one of the most impactful strategies is directing a greater focus towards <strong>reduction, reuse, and donation</strong>.</p><p>The following graphic from the <a href="https://zwia.org/">Zero Waste International Alliance</a> helps reframe the way we look at the hierarchy of waste management in event management from “what can we recycle?” to “what can we rethink, reduce, and reuse?” The colored bands below highlight that our most effective strategies for sustainable events apply to the design stages and prioritize reduction over recycling.</p><p><img alt="" class="wp-image-39081 aligncenter" height="430" loading="lazy" sizes="(max-width: 701px) 100vw, 701px" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zero-waste-international-graphic.png" srcset="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zero-waste-international-graphic.png 1957w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zero-waste-international-graphic-300x184.png 300w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zero-waste-international-graphic-1024x629.png 1024w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zero-waste-international-graphic-768x472.png 768w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zero-waste-international-graphic-1536x943.png 1536w, https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/zero-waste-international-graphic-400x246.png 400w" width="701"/></p><p>If you are looking for a good place to begin on your reuse and reduction journey, starting with reusable service ware and reducing single-use plastics is a great first step.</p><p><strong>Single-Use Plastic</strong></p><p>While recycling programs are still a valuable strategy to mitigate our waste, an unfortunately grim statistic is that less than 2% of the total waste stream in the United States is actually recycled. When it comes to plastic bottles, which on the surface seems like one of the simplest items to recover, a staggering 90% are not recycled.</p><p>There are a number of reasons for these low recovery rates: cost competition with virgin plastic, changes in commodity (recycled material) value, lack of advanced processing technology, and most recently the enforcement of China’s National Sword inspection program which imposes a much tougher standard for contamination levels on plastic and other materials.</p><p>To help illustrate the tremendous impact that using reusable service ware can have, in the graphic below one reusable fork alone, <em>estimated to be used 2,500 times</em>, has the following savings compared to 2,500 disposable forks used one once before being discarded:</p><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-39079">Source: https://meetgreen.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/MeetGreen-Follow-The-Fork.pdf</p><p><strong>Carbon Emissions</strong></p><p>When we look at the full carbon footprint of an event, in the vast majority of cases, air travel makes up 90%-95% of that impact. This is one of the primary reasons so much attention is rightly being paid to conference flight and travel miles. <em>Assessing your destination choice through the lens of where your attendee base is most heavily located will have on the biggest impacts on reducing your miles traveled</em>. Conference organizers should be open to the idea that hosting responsibility and physical location are separable; that a university is putting on an event does not mean that the event must be held at or near the university if an alternative destination means fewer aggregate miles traveled by attendees.</p><p>A critical next step towards climate action is taking a moment to identify where fossil fuel combustion is occurring and then ideally combine with some level of benchmarking and measurement. This process of emissions “discovery” is essential to helping build a meaningful reduction strategy as well as for assessing goals and progress. In this way, your team’s climate action plan should include with a basic “<em>carbon footprint</em> <em>assessment</em>”.</p><p>Regardless of your event’s size, attendance, or level of production, transportation is still most likely its largest source of emissions. In this way, every bit saved counts. To put things in perspective, a six-hour online event for 4,000 people causes roughly the same carbon impact as a <em>return flight for one person across the Atlantic</em>.</p><p>There clearly is a value to convening in person and setting an emissions baseline through your carbon footprint assessment is the best way to approach planning—armed with data to better define and approach your reduction strategies. By being aware of your carbon footprint, it can for example, help teams determine whether meeting in-person twice a year is sufficient instead of four. In another case, by setting emissions thresholds for meeting in-person, teams can better consider what format for convening is worth the environmental cost. It does not have to be an all or nothing proposition. By trimming some of our excess, our “less necessary” travel, we can approach emissions reduction in a more conscious, strategic, and methodical way.</p><p>When we determine a physical event is necessary, we can lessen the impact of travel via neutralizing its emissions impact through financially supporting verified projects that draw-down, sequester, or reduce an equivalent amount of CO2. This process is often referred to as “carbon offsetting”. While offset projects do have a monetary cost, funds can be raised via sponsorship, registration fee, “opt-in” charges, or even attendee donations. All of the above are presently happening in our current event landscape and are certainly worth piloting in your upcoming events. Emissions accounting and accountability will be a critical topic facing events, conferences, and gatherings in all forms over the next decade and beyond—so the time to get started is now!</p><p><strong>Circularity</strong></p><p>Related to both waste and emissions, historically our consumption has often followed a linear model, which flows from production to disposal in a straight line. A circular economy related to events, when implemented, begins to eliminate waste and reduce emissions in all forms. and even designing those marketing and way-finding items that cannot be migrated to digital formats, for reuse. The work we are doing now is setting the stage for a more circular and sustainable future.</p><p class="wp-caption-text" id="caption-attachment-39080">Source: https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/circular-economy-concept-explained/462/</p><p><strong>Returning Onsite &amp; Attendee Engagement</strong></p><p>At their core, environmental problems are also <em>education</em> problems. For many teams and business units, returning back onsite for physical events, one of the questions they have been receiving the most is: <em>can events still be sustainable in 2021 given COVID-19 restrictions and regulations?</em></p><p>This is a question we have thought quite a bit about. When assessing our 16 physical event minimum sustainability practices in light of CDC guidance, we found that 16 of those 16 were safe to move forward with during the return to physical events. This assessment revealed a much higher degree of “green light” initiatives than we were initially expecting. Our discoveries reinforced to us that at least from the sustainability perspective, many items like food donation, already protected by strict chain-of custody-protocols, are not likely to be impacted by our emerging physical and hybrid events. For those seeking additional information on this topic, MeetGreen has produced several <a href="https://meetgreen.com/event-resources/sustainable-safe-events/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">website resources</a> dedicated to returning to events safely and sustainably.</p><p>The more your organization can enroll, engage, and educate your attendees arounds its sustainability journey and goals, the more it will enrich your collective participation across the <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/decade-of-action/">United Nation’s Decade of Action</a>.

This is interesting. MeetGreen’s take on food, however, is depressing. These are the tips I could find: <a href="https://meetgreen.com/event-resources/meetgreen-tips/making-food-beverage-decisions/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://meetgreen.com/event-resources/meetgreen-tips/making-food-beverage-decisions/</a></p><p>Nowhere do they mention the carbon footprint of meat and dairy. Instead, it’s the well-worn (and largely debunked) Eat Local and Organic and choose sustainable seafood (whatever that means). The tool to calculate your event footprint does suggest it’d be good to choose veg over beef for one meal, though.</p><p>Many of their recommendations are sound and fairly easy to implement. But the carbon footprint of food, especially animal agriculture, is massive enough that not even mentioning it is frankly disappointing. Most conference attendees can skip beef AND chicken for a couple days. This will make a bigger difference than choosing the apple over the banana.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425123"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425123', '010934a755', '39019');">Report</a></span></p><p>The Philosophers for Sustainability guidelines for sustainable practices in philosophy also seem relevant here: <a href="http://www.philosophersforsustainability.com/guidelines/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.philosophersforsustainability.com/guidelines/</a><span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425132"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425132', '5a2ca58ee0', '39019');">Report</a></span></p><p>This post is kinda cool insofar as ut goes, but it really doesn’t even touch the major issues like disparate funding, stressors on family life (which disproportionately affect women), cliquiness/clubiness at conferences, alternatives to conferences (e.g., Zoom), and so on.

As you know, I’m on the side of having a much higher proportion of virtual to in-person conferences than in the past. </p><p>Regardless, I hope more in-person organizers think about the points you mention here (perhaps in connection with<a href="https://cdn.ymaws.com/www.apaonline.org/resource/resmgr/docs/Good_Practices_Guide_-_Sec_9.pdf" rel="noopener nofollow ugc" target="_blank"> the APA/PfS guidelines Karl linked to</a>). </p><p>As you say, the biggest environmental impact by far is travel, so I hope there’s more of a shift to regional conferences. That’s easier in some regions than others, and can run the risk of excluding people at more remote institutions – but then again, organizing a regional conference can prompt philosophers at bigger/wealthier institutions to get to know philosophers at nearby smaller/less wealthy institutions (it’s awfully easy to slip into R1 elitism as an organizer).

But as critics such as </span><a href="https://press.princeton.edu/books/hardcover/9780691174655/the-case-against-education"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Bryan Caplan</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, </span><a href="https://dailynous.com/value-of-philosophy/charts-and-graphs"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Jason Brennan, and Phillip Magness</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have recently observed, it’s not clear how much of this result is a treatment effect and how much is a selection effect. Perhaps earning a degree in philosophy actually makes you a lot smarter. But perhaps it was only the smart students who decided to major in philosophy in the first place.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In order to know with high certainty whether studying philosophy makes you better at the GRE and other standardized tests, much less whether it makes you smarter, we’d have to run randomized, controlled trials, and even those wouldn’t be double-blind; after all, most students have a pretty good idea what their college major is. Therefore, the best we can do right now is to try to estimate how academically skilled </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">incoming </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">philosophy students are and compare that to philosophy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">graduates’ </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">academic skills. To do so, we can survey SAT and ACT scores and compare those to GRE, LSAT, and GMAT scores, plus compare SAT and ACT scores to law-school and medical-school admission rates. If incoming first-year philosophers are only of average academic skill relative to their peers, but are of high academic skill relative to their peers when they graduate, then this is prima facie evidence that the graduates’ philosophy programs actually gave them those skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we’ll see, despite some limitations and challenges, there is some evidence that this is in fact the case. In some areas, especially writing and reasoning, a philosophy education seems to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">create</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> measurable improvements in academic skill versus most of the common majors.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I decided to collect standardized-test and admissions-rate data as best I could. But let me admit to some complications and limitations of my approach.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Those are the main limitations of this research. And here’s one more limitation: I’m not a social scientist. Maybe there are better social scientists out there who can take this approach and make it more rigorous or probative. If so, I welcome their contributions to this exploration. I primarily wanted to see whether there were any interesting results and to initiate this conversation. And since measurable results matter to the kinds of people who make decisions about which programs to preserve, this is an important conversation to have right now.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this section, I’ll compare the “contributions” each major makes to each of the postgraduate examinations and admission rates. I’ll list the majors under consideration in the particular topic as well as philosophy-and-religion’s rank.

(See <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/07/14/philosophy-majors-high-standardized-test-scores/#notes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Notes</a> 1 and 2.)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;">How to read this table and subsequent tables</span></strong></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The columns represent the contribution to the verbal GRE score, the quantitative-reasoning GRE score, the GRE writing score, the LSAT, the law-school admission rate, the GMAT and the med-school admission rates.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first row of data is the average (mean) contribution that actually getting a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">degree </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in philosophy or religion makes, in percentage points, to </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">post</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">graduate tests, versus what we would expect from </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">intended </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">philosophy majors’ </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">ACT</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> scores. For example, studying philosophy and religion makes you score 19.09 percentage points higher versus the average. If intended philosophy-and-religion majors score 2% </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">worse</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the average ACT score, and they score 17.09% </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">better</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> than the average GRE Writing score, then the average contribution of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">studying</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> philosophy is 19.09 percentage points.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The second row is the average contribution across all ten of the previously listed majors. For example, on average, studying one of those majors makes you drop 2.64 percentage points from the average GMAT score versus what your ACT would have predicted. Maybe the average among the listed intended majors is to do 4% better than average across all test-takers on the ACT but 6.64% worse than the average across all test-takers on the GMAT, or something like that. (Why would the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">average</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> among these very common majors be </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">negative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">? My guess is that “undecided” intended majors, and intended majors in esoteric fields, are generally more academically skilled than the average student is.)</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third row is how many percentage points philosophy and religion do better than the average across those ten majors. We just subtract the second data row from the first.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The fourth row is the rank for philosophy and religion out of those ten majors by the magnitude of its contribution. As you can see, philosophy and religion are the best out of the ten for the GRE Writing section, the GMAT, and the med-school admission rate. They’re very good everywhere else.</span></p><p><strong>Contributions versus SAT Subscores</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the set of major fields of study comprising:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">philosophy and religion or philosophy, religion, and theology (“P&amp;R”) contribute the following values of percentage-points, and ranks, versus the average scores across all twelve majors:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary: Given what you’d expect from the SAT subscores of intended philosophy or religion majors, philosophy and religion graduates do slightly better than average on the GRE verbal and math sections, but extremely well on the writing section.</span></p><p><strong>Contributions versus SAT Comprehensive Scores</strong></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the set of major fields of study comprising:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">philosophy and religion or philosophy, religion, and theology (“P&amp;R”) contribute the following values of percentage-points, and ranks, versus the average scores across all ten majors:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Summary: Given what you’d expect from intended philosophy and religion majors’ SAT comprehensive scores, philosophy and religion majors do average on the LSAT, do well on law-school admission, and do extremely well on the GMAT and on med-school admission. (See <a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/07/14/philosophy-majors-high-standardized-test-scores/#notes" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Notes</a> 3 and 4.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given what we would predict from ACT comprehensive-score results, philosophy and religion make a much-better-than-average contribution to all these tests and admission rates, including a huge contribution to GRE Writing and to the GMAT.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given what we would predict from SAT comprehensive and subscore results, philosophy and religion make an average contribution to GRE Verbal Reasoning and Quantitative Reasoning, a huge contribution to GRE Writing, a large contribution to law-school admissions, a huge contribution to GMAT scores, and a huge contribution to med-school acceptance rate. (See Complications and Limitations above, of course.)</span></p><p><a href="https://www.usnews.com/education/best-colleges/articles/act-vs-sat-how-to-decide-which-test-to-take"><span style="font-weight: 400;">One common view</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> says that the ACT is kinder to writing-oriented students and the SAT is kinder to math-oriented students. I don’t know whether that’s true, but if so, then the enormous gain to philosophy majors in the verbal and writing sections of the GRE versus the SAT is even more impressive.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Given the magnitude of some of these effects, and philosophy majors’ similar performance throughout the recent past (my GRE data are </span><a href="https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_guide_table4.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2017-20</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> but similar data are available from e.g. </span><a href="https://dailynous.com/value-of-philosophy/charts-and-graphs/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">2015-18</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">) I think “chance” is a poor explanation for philosophy majors’ overall performance on standardized tests and admissions. I think the two best explanations are “mostly a selection effect” (i.e., people who are already academically skilled choose to major in philosophy) and “mostly a treatment effect” (i.e., a philosophy education makes people a lot more academically skilled, at least in writing, law-school-relevant reasoning, GMAT-relevant reasoning, and maybe med-school-relevant qualifications). But, crucially, given that intended philosophy-and-religion majors aren’t that impressive relative to other intended majors, this is prima facie evidence that a substantial portion of the effect is treatment. In all likelihood, studying philosophy confers a non-negligible benefit to your GRE-Writing-related and your GMAT-related academic skills, and more of a benefit than most other majors would have conferred.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Some minor potential objections are already addressed in the “Complications and Limitations” section above. Here are some of the strongest objections.</span></p><p><b>Objection 1</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “These are just </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">intended </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">majors at the time of taking the ACT or SAT, not necessarily the majors ultimately declared.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Reply 1 to Objection 1</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Yes, intended philosophy-and-religion majors are of </span><a href="https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/R1711-major-consistency.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">lower than average</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> likelihood of declaring the major that they claim to intend. Part of that effect may also be that the just-linked report included two-year colleges, and more generally, that many colleges don’t offer majors in philosophy and religion anyway. Thus the consistency between intending to major in philosophy or religion and actually majoring in philosophy or religion </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at a college that allows one to graduate with a degree in philosophy or religion</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is probably higher.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">In any case, we’re not just comparing philosophy-and-religion to some other variable; we’re comparing all majors </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">to each other</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. So even if philosophy-and-religion intended majors are less likely than average to stick with that major, then to maintain that average, some other set of students must be more likely than average to stick with their major, and so the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">relative</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> performance of philosophy-and-religion is still significant. Students in general are about </span><a href="https://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/R1711-major-consistency.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">56% likely</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to stick with the major they “intend” to major in. If you want to cut all of the net effects listed above by 44%, philosophy and religion still look very good. </span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Reply 2 to Objection 1</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Yet suppose we assume that all students who intend to major in </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">X</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are only 56% likely to become actual </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">X</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">-majors. Even then, we can appeal to an analogue of Condorcet’s Jury Theorem: as long as reliability is at-least-somewhat more than 50%, and the sample is large enough, random noise will partially cancel out in the verdict. </span><a href="https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/gre_interpreting_scores.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">About 1.5 million people took the GRE in the period surveyed</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. And as noted, people are about 56% likely in general to stick with their intended major, at least when they enroll.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Yes, it’s possible that somehow, by pure coincidence, only academically skilled students switched into philosophy and only not-so-skilled students switched out, but there’s no particular reason to believe there will be a strong effect in any direction. The real-life magnitude of the effect won’t be as high as it appears when we ignore this complication, but it won’t be nothing.</span></p><p><b>Objection 2</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “It’s not just that people might not major in what they intend to major in. After having taken a few college courses, students now have an idea of how difficult their originally intended major is. The academically skilled college students might actually be switching </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">into </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">philosophy and the academically unskilled students might be switching </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">out </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">of it. Hence, the GRE scores are higher than intended-philosophy-major SAT and ACT scores would predict–not because the students in the program took philosophy courses, but because skilled students (who didn’t originally intend to major in philosophy) switched in.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Reply to Objection 2</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Academic performance </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/Datalab/TablesLibrary/TableDetails/12476?subjectId=6&amp;topicId=18&amp;rst=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">is one of the less-important reasons</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> people choose majors. And college students do not perceive philosophy nor religion to be difficult majors. Even at selective colleges, </span><a href="https://journeys.dartmouth.edu/nneumann/2019/01/06/perceptions-of-major-difficulty-at-dartmouth/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">philosophy majors report</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> that philosophy is only somewhat more difficult than non-majors expect it to be, versus many other programs whose majors report that the program is much more difficult than expected. Religion is perceived by both non-majors and majors to be very easy, which is further evidence that unskilled students aren’t switching out of philosophy-and-religion programs. Philosophy majors’ GPAs are </span><a href="https://blog.prepscholar.com/average-college-gpa-by-major"><span style="font-weight: 400;">only about a fifth of a standard deviation lower than average</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Religion majors’ GPAs are high. Populations of philosophy majors </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/d20/tables/dt20_322.10.asp"><span style="font-weight: 400;">have been dropping a lot</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> since the early 2010s and so philosophy departments face some selection pressure to attract more majors, potentially by ensuring that their program is easy. In contrast, they do not face pressure from outside accreditors to add courses to the major nor to prepare students for career-defining standardized tests.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We know that students enroll in humanities majors overwhelmingly </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/Datalab/TablesLibrary/TableDetails/12476?subjectId=6&amp;topicId=18&amp;rst=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">because they enjoy those courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and secondarily because they do well in those courses. In humanities relative to other majors, the latter is far more important. Thus, if we take humanities as a whole, this is further evidence that switching into humanities majors because the other major was too easy doesn’t occur, and switching out because the humanities major was too difficult doesn’t occur. Major switching mainly occurs because students enjoy the courses in their new major more, and partly also because they expect the new major to contribute to society. Humanities as a whole has the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">highest </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">percentage of students switching in because they do well in those courses; if anything, this suggests that students who aren’t as academically skilled are switching </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">into </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">those courses.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Really, </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/Datalab/TablesLibrary/TableDetails/11786?subjectId=6&amp;topicId=18&amp;rst=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">what the data tell us</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> is that it’s mathematics and natural-sciences students who switch majors (i.e. out of math and science) more than anyone else, and </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/Datalab/TablesLibrary/TableDetails/12478?subjectId=6&amp;topicId=18&amp;rst=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">it’s STEM students who switch out because the courses were too difficult</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. But arguably, if that were inflating philosophy’s numbers, it would show up in the quantitative-reasoning numbers. As the data presented herein show, intended math-and-science majors are far better at the math section of the SAT than the intended philosophy-and-religion majors are. Yet a philosophy education only makes an average contribution to quantitative-reasoning scores.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Moreover, of non-STEM fields, </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/Datalab/TablesLibrary/TableDetails/11786?subjectId=6&amp;topicId=18&amp;rst=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the most-common major-switchers</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> are those who switch out of education. We know empirically (see table below) that intended education-majors are among the worst performers on the SAT and ACT, and so if people are switching out of an initially-declared education major into philosophy or religion, that would drive the performance of philosophy and religion majors down, not up.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We can also survey students who </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/Datalab/TablesLibrary/TableDetails/12478?subjectId=6&amp;topicId=18&amp;rst=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">actively did switch majors</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Those who switch out of humanities do not report having done so because those courses were too difficult. Yet a non-negligible portion of </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">new </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">humanities majors switched because the </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">old </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">major’s courses were too difficult. Again, if anything, this is evidence that less-skilled students switch into, not out of, humanities majors.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Granted, people tend to switch into humanities </span><a href="https://nces.ed.gov/Datalab/TablesLibrary/TableDetails/12478?subjectId=6&amp;topicId=18&amp;rst=true"><span style="font-weight: 400;">because they “enjoy” or are “interested in” the courses</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, while people tend to switch into non-humanities majors more often because they expect more pay or to contribute more to society. If enjoyment is a proxy for ease, then perhaps students who are very good at humanities are switching into humanities, while students who aren’t good at humanities are switching out. But that would be more likely to inflate the performance of the students in their undergraduate GPAs, not necessarily on the GRE and so on; the course </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">content </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">in humanities courses isn’t generally identical to GRE or LSAT content. Put another way, if students just enjoyed GRE content, then their switching into some major would inflate that major’s GRE scores. But students don’t report switching into humanities because those students enjoy GRE content.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>Counter-Reply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “But maybe it was the intended math-and-science majors who were </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">bad </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">at math who switched out of those majors and into philosophy.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>Reply to Counter-Reply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: The data (see below) suggest that intended math-or-science majors are </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">so</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> much better at math than intended philosophy majors are that even if the ones who are bad at math are switching into philosophy or religion, that should still be inflating philosophy and religion graduates’ math scores.</span></p><p><b>Objection 3</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Maybe the people who are interested in philosophy as SAT-takers or ACT-takers are the people who are primed to get the most out of a philosophy education.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 40px;"><b>Reply to Objection 3</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: Presumably those who are interested in other fields as SAT-takers or ACT-takers are similarly primed, then, to get the most out of their fields.

But yes, the opportunity cost of generating lots of philosophy majors might be high. I’m not claiming here that the GRE etc. measure anything valuable or worthwhile in terms of, e.g., the productivity of society or the expected, total, net hedons generated per hour of philosophy instruction. That’s a much larger conversation. But my results should give administrators strong reason to provisionally maintain the existence of philosophy departments (and perhaps to include philosophy courses among general-education requirements or core curricula), at least until better data are available.</span></p><p style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>Counter-reply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: “Still, there’s such a low number of philosophy majors at most colleges that it’s not clear that a lot of good is being generated by having philosophy </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">departments</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least in the area of general academic skills.”</span></p><p style="padding-left: 80px;"><b>Reply to Counter-Reply</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">: My guess, although I don’t have data to back it up, is that training has diminishing marginal return. I would guess that you improve a lot more in the first 20 hours of studying the trombone than you do in the second 20 hours.

I also probably learned more </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">philosophy</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in grad school, while I probably learned more </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">general academic skills</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in undergrad philosophy courses. (My teachers in both undergrad at </span><a href="https://phil.washington.edu/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">UW Seattle</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and in grad school at </span><a href="https://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">CU Boulder</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> were excellent, by the way.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The data we have suggest that a philosophy education makes an average contribution to verbal reasoning and to math skills, and a large contribution to analytic-writing skills and to the GMAT-relevant skills: chiefly writing and reasoning. The analytical-writing section of the GRE </span><a href="https://www.ets.org/gre/institutions/about/general/structure/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">matches</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> intended philosophy-education outcomes well. Interestingly, three of the GMAT’s </span><a href="https://www.mba.com/exams/gmat/about-the-gmat-exam/gmat-exam-structure"><span style="font-weight: 400;">four sections</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> match the standardly advertised philosophy-education skills.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As noted, to get better data, we would need to administer something like the GRE to a large cross-section of first-year students, and then again to those graduating seniors, and see which majors or which selections of courses made the largest contribution. Another useful project would be to construct an analogue of the GRE that attempts to measure the main skills </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">that are </span></i><a href="https://www.aacu.org/sites/default/files/files/LEAP/2015_Survey_Report2_GEtrends.pdf"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">normally included</span></i></a><i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> in “general-education requirements”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> and administer that to all students as first-years and as graduates, trying to derive a correlation between the raw number of philosophy courses taken (regardless of major) and performance on this test. It would also be nice to administer a test to first-years and that test again when they’re seniors or graduates, and track these students longitudinally, associating their improvement as graduates versus first-years with how many courses from each discipline they took during their career. I think this is something the </span><a href="https://www.ed.gov/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Department of Education</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> has reason and the resources to do; one would hope that they’d be interested in the effects of taking different sorts of college courses. (Someone might worry that the results would be used to cut certain departments’ budgets. I take that seriously, although I also think that if high-quality research shows that philosophy is useless with respect to some goal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">, then we should at least stop requiring or encouraging philosophy as a way of satisfying that goal</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">.)</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I don’t have the money to perform any of the high-quality research I’ve outlined. Maybe </span><a href="https://www.apaonline.org/default.aspx"><span style="font-weight: 400;">the APA</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, at least, should invest some money running some versions of some of these studies. Given what I’ve presented here, there’s reason for some optimism about the results.

Thanks for your question. I agree that the presentation of the data is unclear in various ways.</p><p>Here’s what I did (and I’m not a social scientist, so this is crude). I compared the performance of intended majors to the average on the ACT and SAT, versus the average across all test-takers. For example, intended philosophy and religion majors averaged 21.2 on the ACT versus 20.8, meaning that they scored 101.9% of the average.</p><p>Then, I looked at how they did on (for example) the GRE Writing section. Philosophy and religion graduates scored 4.27, versus the average across all test-takers of 3.525. Thus philosophy and religion majors scored 121.0% of the average.</p><p>In turn, the “contribution” is the percentage-point difference. So studying philosophy or religion contributed 121.0-101.9 = 19.1 percentage points. I also compared this to the average contribution across the set of majors, which in this case (ACT versus GRE Writing) was 3.45 percentage points.</p><p>Thus, to the degree that it exists, the “prediction” is that intended X-majors will perform exactly as well versus the average (on pre-graduate tests) as actual X-graduates perform versus the average (on post-graduate tests).</p><p>I hope that helps. Again, I don’t pretend to be a social scientist, but I thought these results could at least spark some further discussion.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425125"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425125', 'd4cad9acda', '39064');">Report</a></span></p><p>“smart” or particularly socialized?<br/>

And, as far as I can tell, it’s not a near certainty, or anything approaching a near certainty, that one of the Abrahamic religions is false.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425113"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425113', '6d7d1bb783', '39058');">Report</a></span></p><p>I think you meant to say that it’s not a near certainty that all the Abrahamic religions are false. Given that they are inconsistent with each other, it’s not just a near certainty, but an absolute necessity, that at least two of them are false. And even if one of them is true, it doesn’t follow that humanity won’t come to an end. In fact, Christian eschatology, for example, seems to involve a definite end of humanity. Eternal life is about as unhuman as I can imagine. Not that that’s a bad thing (it might be, I don’t know).<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425120"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425120', '33a1bb304c', '39058');">Report</a></span></p><p>These are really great points — I would say to both Maimonides and Alastair! My view is that, indeed, nearly all world religions are incompatible with human extinction in naturalistic sense, i.e., the sense that biologists, existential risks scholars, etc. would use the term. We cannot disappear the way the non-avian dinosaurs or dodos did, for at least two reasons: ontologically, we have immortal souls (bracketing all sorts of qualifications), and eschatologically, we are part of a prewritten plan for cosmic history that cannot unfold without us. Without a doubt, eternal life is strange (and “unhuman,” as you say), but even with our new glorified bodies (like the one Jesus had after his resurrection), we are still fundamentally human, on the standard Christian account.</p><p>So, yes, I am tacitly assuming that world religions (not just the Abrahamic faiths, but those with cyclical eschatologies as well–Buddhism, Hinduism, etc.) are false. Although (as I discuss in a paper) there are *many* legitimate, distinct, morally relevant interpretations of “human extinction,” most of the survey assumes that we’re discussing “terminal extinction,” whereby (a) the population dwindles to zero, (b) this remains the case forever, and (c) we leave no successors. (Other questions, though, are about phyletic extinction, whereby Homo sapiens become a new posthuman species.) I hope this helps just a little! Thoughts?

I meant that it’s not a near certainty that all of them are false. Thanks for that. And, as I’m sure you know, on the Abrahamic view, eternal life in communion with God and one another is–far from inhuman–precisely what humans are made for. It’s the conditions under which humans fully flourish. So, on Christianity, humans continue to exist forever. You say “those aren’t humans” but that’s because you think Christianity is false, or morally bankrupt, or whatever. Fair enough. But, *according to Christianity*, they’re humans and they’ll live forever.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425134"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425134', '9b55739793', '39058');">Report</a></span></p><p>I wasn’t taking any position on whether eternal existence in the form that some religions posit (as far as I know) is good or bad. I would quite like to live forever, or at least for a lot longer than the actuaries say I will live. I don’t think the question of whether such existence is human or not can be settled by appealing to the claim that this existence is what humans were designed for. Again, taking no position on the truth of these religious claims, it clearly doesn’t follow from the claim that humans were designed to end up the way you’re describing that such an existence constitutes the survival of humanity. Maybe humans were designed to transcend their human existence. Now we’re human. In the future we won’t be human anymore. And that’s the way that God planned it. And it’s a really good thing. Sounds fine to me (at least in theory). I understand “human” to be a biological category.

Is it possible to see the questions again? I do remember thinking many times that you were asking us to make predictions about the future that no-one is anywhere near qualified to make. Some of them seemed to require figuring out whether certain outcomes would contain more or less total well-being than others. At least for those of us for whom that question is relevant (that’s most philosophers, almost no-one denies the relevance of such questions, even if some deny that they are the only relevant questions), an honest answer would always have to be “I simply don’t know”. Take the often-raised question of whether the world would somehow be better without any human beings in it. Given the complexity and multitude of changes from the current situation that would entail, anyone who confidently answers either yes or not to that question simply hasn’t thought about it, even a little bit. The exception would be someone for whom the mere existence of humanity is lexically preferable to any other state of affairs. I think some people claim to believe this, but given how absurdly preposterous a view it is, I prefer to employ the principle of charity and interpret them to be either lying or speaking loosely.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425228"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425228', '98643f6f87', '39058');">Report</a></span></p><p>I don’t think that humanity will come to an end.

This is a striking skew. During the period, 2434 accredited schools awarded bachelor’s degrees. The majority of these schools, 1609 (66%), awarded no philosophy bachelor’s degrees at all. Together, just 125 schools (6% of bachelor’s degree awarding institutions) produced the majority of philosophy majors.</p><p>There are some perhaps surprising disparities. For example, although 4.9% of Penn’s graduates majored in philosophy, other Ivy League schools had much lower percentages: Columbia 2.9%, Princeton 2.3%, Dartmouth 1.9%, Yale 1.7%, Harvard 1.5%, Brown 1.3%, and Cornell 0.6%. It would be interesting to know how much this reflects differences in entering students’ intended majors, compared to policies or experiences affecting students after they arrive on campus. (One possible explanation for Penn’s large numbers and percentage is that NCES might be counting their “Philosophy Politics and Economics” major as philosophy [category 38.01]. Similar classificiation issues might also affect other schools.)</p><p>Here are the top 20 schools by total number of philosophy bachelor’s degrees awarded, 2010-2019 (in parentheses is the % of that school’s graduates completing the philosophy major):</p><p>1.

Notes:<a name="fn1"></a><br/>
1. All numbers include students with philosophy as either their first or their second major. As usual in my analyses, I exclude University of Washington-Bothell, which lists 689 philosophy majors but does not have any major with “philosophy” in the title. This appears to be a classification problem, perhaps of their “Culture, Literature, and the Arts” major or their “Law, Economics, and Public Policy” major. <a name="fn2"></a></p><p>2. Excluded from this list are seminaries, some of which appear to award only philosophy degrees, one school that was operational during only part of the period, another which recently closed, and a third in which all students complete a liberal arts major classified as “philosophy” by the NCES.</p><p><a href="https://dailynous.com/linkout/38949" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><img alt="" class="alignnone wp-image-38950 aligncenter" height="250" loading="lazy" src="https://dailynous.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/thinkeranalytix-teach-students-to-argue-better.gif" width="500"/></a></p><p>ln Eric’s post on his own blog, I asked about the denominator he is using for total undergraduate degrees awarded by an institution. NYU has roughly 26,000 undergraduates, of whom only 7,600 are enrolled in the College of Arts and Science (CAS) <em>which is the only unit that offers a major in philosophy</em>. The only meaningful figure would therefore be the percentage of philosophy degrees among degrees awarded by CAS, not degrees awarded by NYU. Perhaps Eric will clarify here as well as on his own blog.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425008"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425008', 'b6a8b95d2f', '38994');">Report</a></span></p><p>Not every school is going to be divided along the same lines. Some don’t separate out at all. Some have Business schools, or health Sciences colleges, or Conservatory programmes that don’t offer philosophy degrees. The only denominator that would make sense for comparison would therefore be total undergraduates.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425010"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425010', 'e7d2cb94cb', '38994');">Report</a></span></p><p>Your premise supports the opposite conclusion. It’s precisely because not every institution has a nursing school, an engineering school, a school of performing arts, etc., that whole-institution comparisons are meaningless — meaningless about <em>philosophy, </em>that is. Of course, the comparisons will still reveal which institutions are more comprehensive in their offerings of professional degrees, but I assume that’s not what we’re interested in. Another way of putting it would be to say that whole-institution comparisons are informative about the percentage of undergraduates that <em>don’t</em> have access to a philosophy major.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425012"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425012', '365d30ea19', '38994');">Report</a></span></p><p>Interesting point, but a complicated issue!  First, at a practical level, there’s no realistic way to do that kind of analysis with the NCES IPEDS dataset, so I have to do the analyses that are possible.  Second, even if colleges were separated out, students can sometimes jump between colleges — probably with different levels of difficulty at different schools — so it’s not clear that a college level division would get at the intended denominator.  Third, self-selection into colleges upon application, admission, or entrance adds another layer of complication.  (At UCR, we award undergraduate degrees in four different “colleges”: Humanities Arts and Social Sciences, Natural and Agricultural Sciences, Engineering, and Business.  Only the first awards degrees in philosophy, but students often flip between colleges in their first couple of years.)<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425019"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425019', '6e9a82e030', '38994');">Report</a></span></p><p>As a further illustration of the complexity, in the UK you get admitted to read a specific subject. So if one restricted the denominator to students who have access to philosophy during the course of their degree, UK universities would score 100%. But of course it’s still meaningful to ask how large the UG philosophy programs are at UK universities.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425021"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425021', 'daec39416f', '38994');">Report</a></span></p><p>Thanks, Eric. But all of these considerations lead to the conclusion that  comparing percentages of philosophy degrees cannot reveal anything meaningful, because they are a function of so many unrelated parameters. Many things just aren’t worth measuring, Most of the discussion on your blog and on FB is  — well, frankly, it’s embarrassing, because the commentators offer explanations of the statistics without even considering what the numbers represent.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425034"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425034', '469747612e', '38994');">Report</a></span></p><p>Thanks to Eric for collecting this data! <span>That list with the highest percentage of philosophy BA degrees awarded is eye-opening. </span>I see another commenter made this point on Eric’s blog, but I expect there’s a strong correlation between the schools on this list and those with a core curriculum of some sort, either a “Great Books” type program <span>or another set of courses with substantial philosophical texts or content that students are required to take to graduate.</span> I’ve often felt philosophy suffers from a foot-in-the-door problem in attracting majors and this list confirms that.</p><p>One of the clear standouts on the list is Colgate, where I received my undergrad degree. Looking at the NCES IPEDS dataset some more, I see Colgate’s averaged about 30 graduating philosophy majors in the last 6 years. That’s more than double <span>the number at SLACs in its peer group like my own (Wesleyan) and others</span> like <span>Williams, Amherst, Vassar, and Swarthmore. </span>It also surpasses the numbers at some top research universities, which is pretty astounding. But it fits the correlation noted above: apart from its excellent philosophy department, Colgate has a required core curriculum in which many of the philosophy faculty do the heavy lifting. That was in fact my entry point into the major years ago.</p><p>The other clear standout on this list is Chicago. Michael Kremer notes on Eric’s blog that the department benefits from the university’s reputation as well as its core curriculum in attracting majors, but the figure that really stands out to my eye is the jump from an average of graduating majors in the 50s for most of the last decade to <strong><u>82</u></strong> in 2018-19. If something close to that number has held in 2019-20 and 2020-21, it will be an increase in majors of almost 50%. It would be great to learn whether the department’s made any curricular modifications in the last few years that have helped effect this change. Kremer mentions Agnes Callard’s excellent Night Owls series as a draw for students to the major. If such events are responsible for even part of the increase Chicago’s seen in their major enrollments, it suggests one of the things departments without Great Books programs or core curricula might do to solve philosophy’s foot-in-the-door problem is support more extra-curricular activities of the sort exemplified by Night Owls.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425025"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425025', '44d7b17c10', '38994');">Report</a></span></p><p>Some facts about Chicago. </p><p>The undergraduate College has also grown recently, so some of our growth is due to that (though on any case as a percentage of all majors we are doing very well by my lights). </p><p>The last two years will show some fall off though (although I don’t know the exact numbers) — I think there is a general move away from the Humanities due to financial insecurity in the COVID era and selection (with parental pressure) of majors perceived to be “safe.” Still the numbers will be significantly higher than 10 years ago.</p><p>Finally a lot of growth in our major has been in second majors.</p><p>All in all we are proud of the work we do attracting and educating philosophy students.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425043"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425043', '2228c233a8', '38994');">Report</a></span></p><p>Did the OP adjust for the city population, diversity, and school size?

I view this system ultimately as a kind of organized legal theft on the part of the publishers, and the journals and publishers do not actually have any moral claim to this work, even if they do hold a legal claim to it. This is an instance where what is moral and what is legal are simply not the same. I place blame on our professional societies and universities for not objecting more strongly and for failing to insist that things be organized differently. I am happy to see, however, that things are slowly changing, in part due to the pressure exerted by the existence of SciHub. I hope eventually to see a completely different publishing system emerge.</p><p>I do not regard the publishers as the true owners of the works, even when the author has signed away their copyrights to them. Because of this, I see no moral problem with people accessing articles by any means possible, including SciHub. In particular, for whatever it is worth, I hereby grant permission for anyone to access my own academic research articles by any means possible online. But of course, this permission carries no legal weight, since I have in fact been required to sign away the copyrights to my own work, even though I still think of them as mine.</p><p>I believe that comparisons with Napster and the music industry fail on the grounds that most academic authors would be completely happy as I am to have people access their work via SciHub, since they aren’t paid in any case and want only readers, whereas this is not true for most musicians.</p><p>Finally, let me also say categorically that I myself never actually use SciHub, because it is illegal. I also specifically encourage my graduate students not to use it. In fact, just in case they might accidentally use it, I make a point to explain to them in detail all the steps that would be required in order for them to access articles via SciHub. I explain that it would be legally wrong for them ever to use that method to gain access to published articles for free, even though the authors of the articles (who are the true moral owners of the works) would want them to do so.

The transformative power of artificial intelligence is coming to philosophy and the only question is whether philosophers will harness it. In fact, we contend that artificial intelligence (AI) tools will have a transformative impact on the field comparable to the advent of writing.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The impact of the written word on philosophy cannot be overstated. Imagine waking up and learning that, due to a freak cosmic accident, all books, journal articles, notebooks, blogs, and the like had vanished or been destroyed. In such a scenario, philosophy would be made seriously worse off. Present philosophers would instantly suffer a severe loss and future philosophers would be impoverished as a consequence.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The introduction of writing freed philosophers from being solely dependent on their own memory and oral methods of recollection. It enabled philosophers to interact with other thinkers across time, diminishing the contingent influences of time and space, thereby improving the transmission of ideas. Philosophers could even learn about others’ approaches to philosophy, which in turn aided them in their own methodology.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is our position that AI will provide a suite of tools that can play a similar role for philosophy. It is likely that this will require that philosophers help develop and theorize about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What is AI? There are, roughly, two kinds of AI: machine reasoning and machine learning systems. Machine reasoning systems are composed of knowledge bases of sentences, inference rules, and operations on them. Machine learning systems work by ingesting a large amount of data and learning to make accurate predictions from it. GPT-3 is an example of this—see discussion </span><a href="https://dailynous.com/2020/07/30/philosophers-gpt-3/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">here</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">. One can think of the first kind of system—machine reasoning AI—as a deductive and symbolic reasoner and the second—machine learning AI—as learning and implementing statistical rules about the relationships between entities like words.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Like many other technologies, these sorts of systems are expected to continue to progress over the coming decades and are likely to be exceptionally powerful by the end of the century. We have seen </span><a href="https://openai.com/blog/ai-and-efficiency/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">exceptional progress so far</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, the cost of computing power </span><a href="https://aiimpacts.org/trends-in-the-cost-of-computing/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">continues to fall</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and </span><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08807"><span style="font-weight: 400;">numerous</span></a> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1901.08579.pdf"><span style="font-weight: 400;">experts</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> have relatively short timelines. How </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">fast</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> the progress will be is clouded in uncertainty – technological forecasting is a non-trivial affair. But it is not controversial that there will likely be significant progress soon.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">T</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">his being the case, it will be technologically possible to create a number of AI tools that would each transform philosophy:</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is unlikely that these systems will replace human philosophers </span><a href="https://dailynous.com/2021/03/24/hey-sophi-or-how-much-philosophy-will-computers-do/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">any time soon</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, but philosophers who effectively use these tools would significantly increase the quality and import of their work.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">One can envision </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Systematizing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> systems that encode the ideas expressed by the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy into propositions and the arguments they compose. This would enable philosophers to see connections between various positions and arguments, thereby reducing the siloing that has become more common in the field in recent years. Similar tools could parse and formalize journal papers from the 20th century that are seldom engaged with – mining them for lost insights relevant to current concerns. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Simulation</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> tools would generate new insights, as when one asks of the tool “What would Hume think about the Newcomb problem”? Imagine a tool like GPT-3 but one that is better at constructing logical arguments and engaging in discussions. Relatedly, one can envisage a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system that encodes the knowledge of the philosophical community as a kind of super agent that others can interact with, extend, and learn from, like Alexa on steroids.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Despite the great promise of AI, we maintain that unless philosophers theorize about and help develop philosophy-specific AI, it is likely that AI will not be as philosophically useful.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Let us make this concrete with a specific philosophical tool: </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Systematizing</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;">. A Systematizing tool would encode philosophical propositions and relations between them, such as support, conditional likelihood, or entailment. Philosophers may need to work with computer scientists to formulate the propositions and score the relations that the Systematizing tool generates, as well as learn how to use the system in a way that produces the most philosophically valuable relations. It is likely that Systematizing tools and software will be designed with commercial purposes in mind and so they will not immediately port over to philosophical use cases.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Extending this, we can imagine a human-AI hybrid version of this tool that takes submissions in a manner that journals do, but instead of submitting a paper, philosophers would submit its core content: perhaps a set of propositions, the relations between them, and the relevant logic or set of inference rules. The ideal construction of this tool clearly needs to be thought through. If it were done well, it could power a revolutionary </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Reasoning</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400;"> system.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However the AI revolution turns out, philosophical inquiry will be radically different in the future. But the details and epistemic values can be shaped by contributions now. We’re happy to see </span><a href="https://kathleenacreel.com/research.html#transparency"><span style="font-weight: 400;">some</span></a> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00LOOCGB2/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&amp;btkr=1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">of</span></a> <a href="https://philpapers.org/surveys/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">this</span></a> <a href="https://www.mcmp.philosophie.uni-muenchen.de/research/phil_ai/index.html"><span style="font-weight: 400;">work</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;">, and we hope to see more in the future.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>

I once played a game at a philosophy workshop where I prompted even GPT-2 with an abstract of the talk I was listening to and asked the speakers the questions that it generated; they often said they were amongst the most interesting questions on the topic they had ever been asked.  (Some were a little boring, but they were never incoherent.)</p><p>The big issue here is “prompt engineering”.

For instance, here is what it produced as an output in response to the query (+ some prompt engineering) “How does a theist respond to the problem of evil?”:</p><p><em>I am a theist, and I believe in the existence of an omniscient, omnipotent, just deity named God. You would think this belief is incompatible with evil; but it isn’t.</em></p><p><em>In my view, the existence of evil is not a refutation of God’s existence; rather it is one form of evidence for His existence.</em></p><p><em>The existence of evil is what gives us the power to distinguish good and evil. If there were no such thing as evil, then we would have no way to tell right from wrong, or moral from immoral.</em></p><p><em>It is a well-known fact that you cannot make moral judgments without having some concept of evil. Thus, if there were no such thing as evil, it would be impossible to make any kind of moral judgment.</em></p><p><em>The existence of evil also allows us to detect and appreciate good. If there were no such thing as pain, we would have no way to know what it is like to feel good; we might think that all pleasure was normal.</em></p><p>This was the second response to the query. The first response to the query was coherent but denied that God was morally perfect (an unconventional theistic response).<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425044"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425044', '3523807aeb', '38962');">Report</a></span></p><p>That God is not morally perfect would logically follow from this reasoning that evil is necessary for good to exist.

In the above response, GPT-3 is focused on distinguishing, appreciating, and detecting good. I’m not seeing where GPT-3 asserts that evil is necessary for good to exist. The closest GPT-3 gets to this is with the last sentence, but there the point is about feeling good. Second and more directly, I don’t think that God not being morally perfect logically follows from evil being necessary for good to exist. FWIW, many philosophers have denied this, including Leibniz and others who are very strong at logic. Third, to answer your question, GPT-3 struggles with, as Cameron puts it below, “complex logical or semantic entailments.” Depending on the prompt, GPT-3 will sometimes generate very odd responses that are internally inconsistent, e.g.. Work needs to be done on this front, to be sure.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425062"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425062', '0da301d41a', '38962');">Report</a></span></p><p>You are taking these answers of GPT-3 too seriously, as if it wasn’t just mimicking a philosophic babble on language.

The reason this is already very good is that it is asking the language model for something that is a predictive task reasonably inside the data distribution of the training set (e.g., the philosopher-to-be-simulated’s written works).  I think reliable automated philosophical reasoning, systematizing, or formalizing are still a ways off and needing some fundamental tweak of the technology, though the various insights from “distant reading”, social network analyses, or topic modeling from digital humanities are already interesting for some purposes.  </p><p>I think that GPT-3 is probably mastering some kind of public intensions for words, so it’s wrong to dismiss  the representations as purely statistical or non-semantic.

FWIW, really complex logical or semantic entailments that need to be sustained through philosophical argument or debate remains a kind of characteristic weakness of deep learning language models and one of the justifications for hybrid or more rule- and formal ontology-based approaches.  You’ll get some cases where it looks like it is doing things well, but in most cases it makes very puzzling mistakes that humans would not make that seem to reveal a shallow understanding of formal relations all along.  There have already been a number of significant attempts to leverage big data for automated philosophical discourse, but it is a hard problem.  You can make some progress with annotating arguments in a formal markup language and then applying some inference rules to them, but this has the same kind of limitation that all classical expert systems do–the cost of reliable annotation.  An emphasis has then been placed on how to use machine learning to annotate arguments in an automatic or semi-automatic fashion, and perhaps even extract reasoning rules in a similar manner, but like all statistical methods they generate some junk that requires calibration for serious work.  </p><p>Folks who are interested might want to glance at this, for example, and follow some of the publications of those who participated in it:<br/>

It seems odd that we’d attribute some other special quality to them by saying: “No no! Don’t read/write those things literally!” Such an admonition appears only appropriate for describing something silly or trivial. But you can’t just go around telling people not to take certain statements seriously. You have to give more specific reasons why someone should heed your advice. And yet I don’t see any reason here why anyone should treat these phrases differently than how one treats all the other common expressions with which humans communicate in everyday speech. The very notion of ‘literal’ language seems so weirdly artificial and arbitrary when considered apart from its use by actual humans interacting with each other, who presumably intend for such language (at least most of it) implicitly represent human intentions and meanings without being interpreted as anything else — whatever sort of creatures or intelligences might overhear our conversations (or try later on). So assuming there’s nothing particularly unique about reading/writing per se , then what makes it so special that we need such warnings at all?! Even if somehow writing could be construed as uniquely non-literal out there somewhere , it still wouldn’t follow logically that therefore one must interpret written text symbolically rather than otherwise; nor would this entail making absolute reverence for every word contained therein regardless of whether those words make sense given prior knowledge . In fact there’s simply no basis whatsoever upon which either conclusion follows inexorably or intuitively!

This thread is clearly intended as fun and light-hearted, but comparing some philosophers to members of the KKK is neither. I think this is true even if opponents to CRT believe the comparison is funny – for such opponents should be able to realise that the comparison is probably *not* funny to critical race theorists themselves. This creates an unwelcome atmosphere, which seems contrary to the aims of Daily Nous. </p><p>I therefore would like Jason to ask to remove his comment. Note that this is <em>not</em> out of the desire to ‘censor’ his comment, <em>nor</em> because the comment is ‘politically incorrect’ (a dubious notion). I am even happy to admit that in some circumstances, shocking comparisons might be appropriate (after all, many on the left have compared Trump and his supporters to fascists/nazists). But it seems clear to me that the comments to this particular thread are not the appropriate place for comments like this, and might spoil the enjoyment of readers. Again, this is true even for someone who is as critical as CRT as Jason is. For example, I am quite critical of CRT, but I was dismayed to find Jason’s comment in a thread which was otherwise a very fun read. Sometimes, I would just like a place in which we could avoid these discussions, and I think all of us – me, Jason, everyone who commented on Jason’s original post – are responsible to create such an atmosphere.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-424913"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '424913', 'f3a29e3d00', '38945');">Report</a></span></p><p>I can certainly see the merits of a space where people can have fun together without getting into divisive political conversations, jokes, etc.</p><p>The key to resolving the issue must be fairness, though.

(2) I am not sure why you think that in the status quo, without an explicit rule, one side “takes a beating” from the other side. If Jason hadn’t made his original comment, no one would have taken any beating, right? As far as I can see, there are no jokes ‘from the other side’ here, which criticise the types of views held by anti-CRT folks.<br/>
(3) Put all that aside: the fact is that there are no explicit rules in place, and I think we still all have the responsibility to acknowledge that fact and acknowledge the way in which people are likely to respond. And given the lack of rules, I think it was reasonable for Jason to expect his comment to generate a discussion of the sort above; and it was also reasonable to expect that for many people, such discussions turn the comments section here into a less pleasant space. Again, note that I am not claiming that Jason should take into account the way critical race theorists feel about his comments – I am just talking about the way people who are quite neutral about the whole issue feel, but who are otherwise keen to enjoy the puns and jokes in this thread.

But step back and count them up — just the obvious ones — and you’ll see how many they are. You can’t escape them anymore except by isolating yourself from general conversation with philosophers and other academics. And they are almost invariably one-sided. You can’t speak up against all of them, and most of us choose to say something about very few of them. When these things are mentioned, hardly anyone seems to care.

The fact that you’ve branded yourself as an advocate for policing others’ “credibility”, and are castigating those who don’t meet your standards, isn’t helping the situation.

First, my response didn’t occur in a comedy club, where most stand-comedians perform, but a forum for philosophers and would-be philosophers. Since there are different norms in different contexts, this is relevant to the propriety of my response. </p><p>Second, my response was not in response to a stand-up comedian’s joke, but a philosopher’s joke. The standards for the beliefs of comedians are different from those of a philosoper. This is relevant to the propriety of my response, as philosophers are expected to hold sensible beliefs even if comedians aren’t. </p><p>Third, my response wasn’t a heckle, as heckles typically occur as interruptions to a comedian’s set, but the questioning of a joke’s premise after the joke had been made and explained. This difference is relevant to the propriety of my response, as it’s not improper to question a philosopher’s premise even if it is improper to question a comedian’s premise during the set.</p><p>Fourth, the response wasn’t a gripe about politics, but a complaint about the apparent ridiculousness of calling a theory “pro-racism” when its main purpose is to clarify the relationship between racism and laws/government in order to make progress toward the elimination of racism and its effects. This difference is relevant to the propriety of my response, for a mere gripe about politics is a result of a minor disagreement whereas my complaint is not.</p><p>There are likely more, but these four will suffice to make my point.</p><p>These differences have the result that the analogy obscures your point.

I suppose we disagree about the standards of propriety that determine a joke-teller’s epistemic duties vis a vis the complaints of a listener in this forum, and the duties we owe one another as philosophers in public spaces outside our professional work. I just went for a walk, however, and on further reflection I suspect this conversation, as a public affair taking place in this thread, has reached diminishing returns. Plus, I’m out of town for a wedding for the weekend, so I won’t be able to keep up the back and forth.</p><p>But I’d be happy to carry on the conversation via email, if you want. I work a bit in analogical reasoning, for instance, and I’d be happy to debate the merits of our two assessments of some of the analogies I’ve given. I agree with Hegel and Peirce that the analogical inference is central to conceptual change qua progress, and I think people like Paul Bartha and Mary Hesse have done much to plumb the analogical foundations of scientific theory construction in the last half century. I also have some rough-hewn thoughts about CRT I’d be happy to share with you. Or, we could debate the merits of the comedic performance as an aesthetic expression with ethical implications. I’ve done that kind of thing with folks at this board before, and some of it has turned into published work. You can reach me via my website, if you’re interested.

(And importantly for the point I’ll go on to make, your comment did not misunderstand.) You say you agree “that there are good grounds for calling out comments that are inaccurate, unfair, condescending, etc.” This betrays your mistake.</p><p>I didn’t propose calling out *comments*; I proposed calling out contributors. And not for their comments, but for their being foolish, for their being overly confident, etc. I did so because the person can be the proper object of criticism. By exposure to their contributions, we can learn that contributors themselves are foolish, overly confident, etc., and not merely that their comments are. After a contributor (say) repeatedly misunderstands clear and direct prose, and those misunderstandings are conveyed by the person’s contributions, we can learn that the person is foolish, not merely that his comments are. Or (to your point regarding Stovall) when a contributor takes a condescending tone toward someone who has failed to understand his point due to his own repeated failures to clearly and directly express the point, we can learn that he is foolish, not merely that his comments are. So, a person can be the proper object of criticism because of his comments, even if none of his comments is.</p><p>Perhaps you can now understand why calling a person out for being foolish might be called for even if “[h]e didn’t seem to say anything foolish” or make a foolish comment. For it is clear that the foolishness might be properly attributed to the person, not to any particular comment(s). It might be that the person’s comments aren’t themselves foolish, but that he himself is because of his condescending treatment of another.</p><p>The conversation might be improved by call out such things because it can influence contributors’ behaviors. Calling them out can reduce the propensity of some to comment without due forethought. It can also fuel a desire to write clearly and directly, as well as a desire to reason carefully. Finally, it can reduce the likelihood that people will be overly confident in commenting, and that people will be unduly condescending.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425018"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425018', 'e27a36300e', '38945');">Report</a></span></p><p>I should have added that calling people out like this will likely make people better aware of their need for intellectual humility.<span class="pmcc-comments-report-link" id="comment-425022"><a class="hide-if-no-js" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="crowd_control_comments_flag_comment( '425022', '155bb4c2e5', '38945');">Report</a></span></p><p>I’m tempted to take your silence as concession.

For it seems to characterize the one doing the calling out as the main source of the negative outcome (as the “assassin”), when it is in fact the one called out who is the main source. If someone is foolish and called out for it, he and his foolishness are the main sources of the outcome, not the one who called him out. So perhaps “character suicide” is more apt since it seems to chatacterize the foolish person as the main source.</p><p>“Character suicide” also might be better for your purposes if you are one of those people tempted to disparage others for using “harm” and “abuse” in ways you deem to be inapt.

I appreciate the effort. I used to be more worried about people’s perceptions when I shared a view, but I’ve gotten over it as I’ve learned to speak up on these things, for the most part. So I’m comfortable with what I’ve said here, how I’ve said it, and the attitudes I’ve expressed in saying it. And I trust in the ability of readers to sort the wheat from the chaff in the conversation, or determine just where there’s need for more intellectual humility. If we all chose to remain pseudonymous until we had, as Jen says of herself, “secure[d] tenure at a top R1”, there’d be much less interesting conversation taking place in venues like this. </p><p>Still, thanks for chiming in. I suspect the public spaces in the profession would be healthier if more level-headed people were pushing back on the rather fanatical pronouncements given voice in some quarters. And my sense is that personal invective doesn’t gets much uptake in the profession. </p><p>All the same, it’s disappointing to see condemnatory admonishments like those directed at Brennan above. And the call to remove Brennan’s comment, on account of it’s contribution toward an “unwelcome atmosphere” and an “unpleasant space”, strikes me as almost satirical. If I hadn’t seen so much of it, I’d worry about a case of Poe’s Law. </p><p>Anyway, I suspect a person would find that concerns of the sort Jen’s articulated in defense of her decision to remain pseudonymous tend to fade when one begins speaking in one’s own name. And those worries fade, in part, because one is adopting a self-regarding mode of cognition in which what one says is filtered through, as it were, an active perception of oneself from the standpoint of one’s interlocutors, knowing that they will recognize you. </p><p>I think it’s something close to the essence of the human being qua rational animal that one’s good-faith effort to cultivate that kind of stance, as a public performance, does wonders for helping us better express what we feel, think, and intend (the transition from the singular to the plural first-person pronoun was intentional). It’s something like a natural collective habitus, or a capacity we readily acquire (as individuals living in communities we identify with) in the course of normal human development.  And by modelling this stance in the public sphere, we both develop our own fallible capacity for it, and help others recognize and pick it up more readily. </p><p>But that stakes out commitments in the metaphysics of rationality, personal agency, and human nature, while this is a board devoted to quipping on common nouns for different philosophical positions, so I’ll leave it there.

If the answer is ‘no’, then it follow that you are right but I have failed to understand the truth of what you say.</p><p>What about the possibility that you are just wrong? Your question leaves no room for that possibility. It seems that you are not even allowing for the possibility of error. In your mind, you are clearly correct, and the only question is whether I am capable of understanding the truth you possess or not. It doesn’t seem to dawn on you that you might be the one who lacks understanding. A worthy interlocutor would acknowledge the possibility that the other person understands but disagrees.</p><p>Then you wonder whether your supposedly wise responses have led me to become enlightened to the point where I have decided to “be more careful when trying to understand clear and correct prose.” </p><p>This is remarkably condescending. You are not some master at whose feet I have chosen to study. In your own mind, no doubt, your prose is not only clear, but *correct*. This is a cheap move that any arrogant, narcissistic or bullying person can play, with the same results: just take for granted that you are right and the other side is wrong. Once again, it shows a failure to take seriously the possibility that other people can both understand you and reasonably disagree with you.</p><p>Let me say this again: I do not find what you said to be correct or plausible. I have given my reasons for some of it. Your behavior in this exchange, including in the passage I just discussed, makes it seem much less likely to me that you are the sort of person it would be profitable to have a conversation with.</p><p>You are of course free to think that everything you said is clearly correct and that only a lack of enlightenment can account for my not being persuaded by you. I, and other readers here, may reach our own conclusions. Whatever those conclusions are, I don’t intend to contribute more to this discussion.</p><p>No doubt, given how you have acted so far, you will be inclined at this point to add yet another comment making clear how dense I am, and how little I am capable of understanding. Rather than respond to such a thing, I will be inclined to leave this for you in advance: I suggest that you refrain from writing such a thing, since many no doubt are getting a stronger and stronger impression that you, and not I, are intellectually immodest having a hard time understanding things you disagree with.</p><p>But why should you care?

More importantly, it makes most sense in context because I asked the question in response to your failure to reply to a comment in which (1) I said that you misunderstood what I had written, and (2) I attempted to help you understand what you seemed not to understand: why calling a person out for being foolish might be called for even if “[h]e didn’t seem to say anything foolish” or make a foolish comment. In this context, the principle of charity requires this latter interpretation. </p><p>The latter interpretation undermines your grounds for characterizing me as someone who has failed “to take seriously the possibility that other people can both understand [me] and reasonably disagree with [me].” It also undermines the grounds for your insinuation that I am an “arrogant, narcissistic or bullying person.” </p><p>I have been condescending.

Therefore, calling out contributors who use their own names should not be done.</p><p>The second premise is not plausible. The contributors who are to be called out in accord with my proposed rule have violated rules against being overly confident, unduly condescending, foolish, etc. It follows that they are overly confident, unduly condescending, foolish, etc. The reputational costs to such people are reductions in their prospects for jobs, conference invitations, networking opportunities, etc. So calling out contributors in accord with my proposal reduces the likelihood that people who are overly confident, unduly condescending, foolish, etc. will occupy positions conferring influence over students and the philosophical community. Overall, this is a good outcome, not one to avoid. </p><p>Additionally, calling out such people will have a positive influence on the conversations in fora like this one. Calling them out will fuel a desire to reason carefully, write clearly and directly, exercise intellectual humility, etc. As a result, conversations in these fora will be better than they currently are. This is a further good outcome of calling out contributors (not their comments).</p><p>The conclusion to be reached, therefore, is that if calling out contributors using their own names (not their comments) sometimes damages their reputation, then it should be done.
